I T is not impossible that among the English readers 
of this book there may be one who in 1915 and 
1916 was in one of those trenches that were woven 
like a web among the ruins of Monchy-au-Bois. In 
that case he had opposite him at that time the 73rd 
Hanoverian Fusiliers, who wear as their distinctive 
badge a brassard with * Gibraltar ’ inscribed on it 
in gold, in memory of the defence of that fortress 
under General Elliot ; for this, besides Waterloo, has 
its place in the regiment’s history. 

At the time I refer to I was a nineteen-year-old 
lieutenant in command of a platoon, and my part 
of the line was easily recognizable from the English 
side by a row of tall shell-stripped trees that rose 
from the ruins of Monchy. My left flank was bounded 
by the sunken road leading to Berles-au-Bois, which 
was in the hands of the English ; my right was marked 
by a sap running out from our lines, one that helped 
us many a time to make our presence felt by means 
of bombs and rifle-grenades. 

I daresay this reader remembers, too, the white 
tom-cat, lamed in one foot by a stray bullet, who had 
his headquarters in No-man’s-land. He used often 
to pay me a visit at night in my dugout. This creature, 
the sole living being that was on visiting terms with 
both sides, always made on me an impression of 
extreme mystery. This charm of mystery which lay 



X AUTHOR’S PREFACE TO ENGLISH EDITION 


over all that belonged to the other side, to that danger 
zone full of unseen figures, is one of the strongest im¬ 
pressions that the war has left with me. At that time, 
before the battle of the Somme, which opened a new 
chapter in the history of the war, the struggle had 
not taken on that grim and mathematical aspect 
which cast over its landscapes a deeper and deeper 
gloom. There was more rest for the soldier than 
in the later years when he was thrown into one murder¬ 
ous battle after another ; and so it is that many of 
those days come back to my memory now with a 
light on them that is almost peaceful. 

In our talks in the trenches, in the dugout, or on 
the fire-step, we often talked of the * Tommy’; and, 
as any genuine soldier will easily understand, we 
spoke of him very much more respectfully than was 
commonly the case with the newspapers of those 
days. There is no one less likely to disparage the 
lion than the lion-hunter. 

Indeed, the landscape in which we lived at that 
time had something about it of primeval Africa, 
with two mighty forces of nature locked in conflict 
there. It was only now and again that one caught 
sight of a brownish-yellow fleeting shadow against 
the desolate countryside that stretched on and on 
before one’s eyes; or heard, after creeping through 
the wire at night, a whisper or a cough from a post. 
The distant sound of transport, a cloud of smoke 
from a fire hidden from view, fresh chalk spoil 
thrown out on the tortured ground, the monotonous 
duel of the guns stretching on from week to month 
—those were signs that we puzzled over as 



AUTHOR’S PREFACE TO ENGLISH EDITION xi 


though they were the runes of a secret book or the 
spoor of some mighty and unknown beast that came 
nightly to drink. 

As time went on, it grew more and more dangerous 
to lift a corner of the veil that fell like a magic hood 
over the spectre that was at once so near and so 
fatally far off. Raids undertaken to get a glimpse 
of the enemy's lines and some information about 
what was going on there became less frequent and 
more exacting as the volume and mass of war material 
increased. A more and more terrific barrage had 
to be put down before ten or twenty picked men, 
armed to the teeth, could make their occasional and 
exceedingly brief appearances in the opposing trenches. 
What the survivors brought back with them was the 
memory of a rapid and frantic glance into Vulcan’s 
white-hot cauldron. 

Still, there were moments of another kind when 
the deep discord and the even deeper unity of this 
landscape came more clearly to one’s mind. It was 
strange, for example, to hear at night the cry of the 
partridges from the waste fields, or at dawn the careless 
song of the lark as it rose high above the trenches. 
Did it not seem then that life itself was speaking out 
of the confidence of its savage and visionary heart, 
knowing very well that in its more secret and essential 
depths it had nothing to fear from even the deadliest 
of wars, and going its way quite unaffected by the 
superficial interchange of peace and war ? 

But then, too, did not this life, ruthless towards its 
creatures, superior to the pain and pleasure of the 
individual, looking on with indifference while its 



xii AUTHOR’S PREFACE TO ENGLISH EDITION 

passive forces were melted down in the crucible of 
war, enter very clearly even into the soldier’s simple 
mind ? Many a time, in that quiet interlude after 
sunset before the first Verey light went up, this 
message was brought very near to the soul by the 
song of an outlying post waiting for the night relief. 
There was a deeper homesickness there than any 
peace in this world can set at rest. 

Then the fire-step was manned once more, the 
relief moved off along the communication trenches, 
and the brisker rifle-fire of the night-time broke 
out; the ear was again on stretch to catch the pulse- 
beat of that other life under arms over there in the 
darkness. And often the Verey lights went up in 
dozens and the trench got lively when a patrol had 
crept up to our wire. 

To-day there is no secret about what those trenches 
concealed, and a book such as this may, like a trench- 
map years after the event, be read with sympathy 
and interest by the other side. But here not only 
the blue and red lines of the trenches are shown, 
but the blood that beat and the life that lay hid 
in them. 

Time only strengthens my conviction that it was 
a good and strenuous life, and that the war, for all 
its destructiveness, was an incomparable schooling of 
the heart. The front-line soldier whose foot came 
down on the earth so grimly and harshly may claim 
this at least, that it came down cleanly. Warlike 
achievements are enhanced by the inherent worth of 
the enemy. Of all the troops who were opposed to 
the Germans on the great battlefields the English 



AUTHOR’S PREFACE TO ENGLISH EDITION xiii 

were not only the most formidable but the manliest 
and the most chivalrous. I rejoice, therefore, to have 
an opportunity of expressing in time of peace the 
sincere admiration which I never failed to make clear 
during the war whenever I came across a wounded 
man or a prisoner belonging to the British forces.

THE STORM OF STEEL 


ORAINVILLE 

T HE train stopped at Bazancourt, a small town 
in Champagne, and there we got out. With 
unbelievable awe we listened to the slow pul¬ 
sation of the machinery of the front, a tune to which 
long years were to accustom us. Far away the white 
ball of a shrapnel shell melted into the grey December 
sky. The breath of the war passed by us with its 
peculiar horror. Did we imagine that nearly every one 
of us would be swallowed up in the days when that 
dull muttering over there broke out into unceasing 
thunder . .. one earlier, another later ? 

We had left lecture-room, class-room, and bench 
behind us. We had been welded by a few weeks’ 
training into one corporate mass inspired by the 
enthusiasm of one thought ... to carry forward the 
German ideals of ’70. We had grown up in a material 
age, and in each one of us there was the yearning for 
great experience, such as we had never known. The 
war had entered into us like wine. We had set out in 
a rain of flowers to seek the death of heroes. The war 
was our dream of greatness, power, and glory. It was 
a man’s work, a duel on fields whose flowers would be 
stained with blood. There is no lovelier death in the 
world .. . anything rather than stay at home, anything 
to make one with the rest.... 

Our fevered thoughts cooled down as we marched 
through the heavy chalk loam of Champagne. Pack 
and ammunition and rifle weighed on us like lead. 

A

ORAINVILLE 


At last we reached the village of Orainville, the rest- 
place of the 73rd Fusiliers, a little spot typical of 
that neighbourhood, consisting of fifty cottages built 
of brick or flint round a park-enclosed chateau. 

The traffic in the village street was strange to eyes 
accustomed to peace conditions. There were only a 
few uneasy and unkempt civilians to be seen. Every¬ 
where there were soldiers in worn and torn coats, with 
tanned faces and thick beards, who went to and fro 
with long swinging strides, or lounging in small groups 
at the cottage doors assailed us newcomers with chaff. 
At one place there was a cooker smelling of bean soup 
and surrounded by a ration-party clattering dixies. 
The Wallenstein-like romance was heightened by the 
incipient dilapidation of the village. 

After spending our first night in a huge barn, we 
were paraded before the adjutant, Lieutenant (as he 
then was) von Brixen, in the courtyard of the chateau, 
and told off to our companies ; mine being the gth. 

Our first day of the war was destined to make a 
very distinct impression on us. We were sitting in 
the schoolhouse, where we were quartered, having 
breakfast. Suddenly there was a series of heavy 
explosions close by and soldiers rushed from every 
house and crowded to the entrance of the village. We 
followed their example without knowing why. Again 
there was the peculiar whisper and fluster overhead 
that we had never before heard, drowned in a terrific 
crash. I was surprised to see the men round me 
crouching as if bent under terrific pressure. 

Immediately after, black groups appeared in the 
empty village street, bearing black bundles on stretchers

or on joined hands. A feeling of unreality oppressed 
me as I stared at a figure streaming with blood whose 
limbs hung loose and who unceasingly gave a hoarse 
cry for help, as though death had him already by the 
throat. He was carried into a cottage with the Red 
Cross flag over the door. What was all this, then ? 
The war had shown its claws and torn off its pleasant 
mask. It was so mysterious, so impersonal. One 
had scarcely given a thought to the enemy carrying on 
his secret and malignant existence somewhere behind. 
The impression of something arising entirely from 
beyond the pale of experience was so strange that it 
was difficult to see the connection of things. It was 
like a ghost at noon. 

A shell had hit the entrance of the chiteau and had 
struck a mass of stones and masonry into the doorway 
just as the inmates, terrified by the previous shell-burst, 
were flocking out. There were thirteen casualties— 
among them the bandmaster, Gebhard, whom I knew 
well by sight from the Promenade Concerts at Hanover. 
A horse standing tied up at the steps realized the 
danger before the human beings, and breaking loose 
galloped unhurt into the courtyard. 

I could tell from talking to my companions that 
this episode had somewhat damped their martial 
ardour. It had affected me too. I seldom heard the 
rumble of a passing lorry without mistaking it for the 
sound of that deadly shell. 

In any case, however, it was our fate all through the 
war to start at any sudden and unexpected sound. 
Whether a train clattered by, or a book fell on the floor, 
or a cry rang out at night, the heart always stood still 



4 


ORAINVILLE 


for a moment in the belief that some great and unknown 
danger threatened. It was the sign of living four years 
under the shadow of death. The effect upon the dark 
regions that lie beneath the consciousness was so deep 
that at the least interruption of the usual course Death 
started up with warning hand, or as he does in those 
clocks where he appears above the dial at every hour 
with sand-glass and scythe. It was a sensation over 
which habit could not prevail, since the instinct of self- 
preservation remains always the same. The notion 
that a soldier becomes hardier and bolder as war 
proceeds is mistaken. What he gains in the science 
and art of attacking his enemy he loses in strength of 
nerve. The only dam against this loss is a sense of 
honour so resolute that few attain to it. For this 
reason I consider that troops composed of boys of 
twenty, under experienced leadership, are the most 
formidable. 

On the evening of the same day came the moment 
we had so long desired, when, heavily laden, we set out 
for the line. Our way led through Betricourt, whose 
ruins stood up fantastically in the dusk, to a lonely 
ranger’s lodge concealed in pine woods, known as the 
Fasanerie. This was battalion reserve, and the 9th 
Company was in reserve till that night. The officer 
commanding was Lieutenant R. Brahms. 

We reported and were detailed to our platoons, and 
soon found ourselves surrounded by bearded, mud- 
caked companions, who greeted us with a certain 
ironical good-humour. They asked us how things 
were going in Hanover and whether the war was going 
to end soon. Then the talk fell to laconic remarks 



ORAINVILLE 5 

about trenches, cookers, shell-fire, and other matters 
of trench warfare. 

After a while there was a shout to ‘ turn out ’ at the 
entrance of our hut-like shelter. We fell in with our 
sections, and at the command ‘Laden und sichern’ 
we put a clip of live cartridges into the magazine with 
secret joy. 

Then in silence and in single file we went across 
country through the night, in a landscape studded with 
clumps of woodland. Now and then a single shot rang 
out, or a rocket fizzed up and after a brief and ghastly 
illumination left the darkness blacker than before. 
The dull clink of rifles and entrenching tools was varied 
by the warning cry, ‘ Look out: wire ! * 

Then suddenly a rattle and a crash, and a curse : 
‘ Can’t you open your mouth when there’s a shell- 
hole coming ? ’ 

The corporal takes up the tale. * Shut up, blast 
you! Do you think the French have mud in their 
ears ? ’ We get on quicker. The dark of night, the 
glimmer of a Verey light, the slow flicker of rifle-fire, 
induce a tremulous, alert state of the nerves ; occasion¬ 
ally a chance bullet sings by, cool and thin, over¬ 
head and is lost in the distance. How often since 
then have I gone up the line in a mood half of excite¬ 
ment and half of melancholy through scenes of utter 
desolation! 

Finally we were lost to sight in one of those trenches 
that wind like white serpents through the night to the 
front line. Once there, I woke to find myself alone and 
shivering. I was staring intently over the parapet at a 
row of firs in front of the trench, among which my fancy 



6 


ORAINVILLE 


conjured up shadowy figures on every side, while now 
and then a stray bullet crashed through the branches. 
The only change during these almost endless hours was 
that an older hand took me by a long, narrow sap to a 
post in front of the line, and there we occupied ourselves, 
as I had done before, in keeping a look-out. For two 
hours after that I was allowed to sleep the sleep of 
exhaustion in a bare hole in the chalk. By dawn I was 
as white and chalky as the rest. I felt as though I had 
lived this mole’s life for months. 

The regiment’s front was opposite the village of Le 
Gauda in the chalk hills of Champagne. On the right 
was the destroyed Garnet wood ; then the line zig¬ 
zagged through large fields of sugar-beet, among which 
the red trousers of those who had fallen in the previous 
attacks were conspicuous, and ended in low ground 
where touch with the 74th had to be maintained by 
means of night patrols. The beck flowed over the weir 
of a destroyed mill, surrounded by gloomy trees. It 
was an eerie spot to be in when the moon threw shifting 
shadows between rifts of cloud and when strange sounds 
seemed to be mingled with the murmur of the water 
and the whisper of the reeds. 

Trench life here was as exhausting as it well could 
be. The day began before dawn, when every man had 
to be standing-to. From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. only two 
men from each section might be sleeping, which 
worked out at two hours sleep per man, and even this, 
owing to being wakened earlier or having straw to fetch 
and one thing or another to attend to, was often illusory. 

Either we were on guard in the trench or else we went 
out to one of the numerous posts which were connected 



ORAINVILLE 


7 


with the front line by long saps. These posts were 
intended to add security to the front line, but as trench 
warfare developed they were found too exposed and 
were given up. 

This endless and terribly exhausting round of night 
guards was endurable in fine weather and even in frost. 
They were a positive torture when it rained, as it usually 
does in January. When the wet penetrated first the 
ground sheet pulled over your head, then coat and 
tunic, and then trickled, hour after hour, down your 
skin, there resulted a state of depression that was im¬ 
pervious even to the cheering sounds of the relief 
wading along towards you. The first light of dawn 
shone on exhausted chalk-smeared figures that, with 
chattering teeth and white faces, threw themselves 
down on the dirty straw of the dripping shelter. Those 
shelters! They were holes hacked out in the solid 
chalk wall of the trench and covered with a layer of 
boards and a few shovels of soil. When it rained they 
dripped the whole day after. With a certain gallows 
humour they were called * dripping wells,’ * men’s 
baths,’ and so on. If more than one desired to take 
their rest in them they were compelled to put their legs 
in the trench, where they formed excellent man-traps 
for passers-by. Under these circumstances there was 
little question of sleep during the day, even if there 
had not been two hours on guard, cleaning the trench, 
fetching food, coffee, and water, and a lot else. 

It may be imagined that this unaccustomed life came 
very hard on us, particularly as the old soldiers were 
quite knowing enough to take advantage of us in every 
possible manner. They brought this habit with them 



8 


ORAINVILLE 


from life in barracks, and in this way added some 
bitterness to days hard enough already. There was an 
end to it, however, when we had once been under fire 
together. The common soldier could not easily 
swallow the fact that we were volunteers. He took it 
to be a sort of bumptiousness on our part. I often 
encountered this notion during the war. 

It was not much better when the company was in 
reserve. Our quarters then were small mud huts 
covered with branches of fir trees near the Fasanerie 
or in Hiller wood, where the ground, deep in manure, 
gave at least the pleasant warmth of a hot-bed. Many 
a time one waked in a puddle inches deep. Though up 
to now I had known rheumatism only by name, it was 
not many days before I felt it in every joint through 
being always wet to the skin. Here, too, the nights 
were not for sleeping. They were used for deepening 
the numerous communication trenches. 

A ray of light in this scene of dreary monotony 
was the arrival of the cooker every evening at the 
corner of Hiller wood. When the lid was taken off 
the dixies a wonderful smell of beans-and-bacon or 
something else as delightful was wafted abroad. But 
here too there was a dark spot: desiccated vegetables, 
reviled by fastidious gourmets as * wire entanglements ’ 
or * damaged crops.’ 

Under January 6th I even find in my diary the follow¬ 
ing indignant observation : ‘ In the evening the cooker 
waddled up and brought a filthy mess, probably 
stewed up out of frozen turnips/ On the other hand, 
under the 14th there is the enthusiastic entry: ‘Wonder¬ 
ful bean soup, four rations, pangs of satiety. We had 



ORAINVILLE 


9 


an eating competition and disputed which position 
was the best for putting it down. I was for stand¬ 
ing to it.’ 

The days of rest at Orainville were the best. They 
were spent in having one’s sleep out, cleaning equip¬ 
ment, and training. The company was quartered in a 
huge barn which had two step-ladder stairs as the only 
way in. We had stoves in spite of the building being 
full of straw. One night I rolled against one of them, 
and was only awakened by the attentions of several of 
my pals who were making violent efforts to extinguish 
me. To my horror I found that my uniform was badly 
charred behind, and in consequence I had to go about 
for a considerable time in a species of frock-coat. 

After a short while with the regiment we had pretty 
well lost the illusion with which we had set out. In¬ 
stead of the dangers we had hoped for, only mud and 
work and sleepless nights had fallen to our lot, and the 
conquest of these called for a heroism that was little 
to our taste. This continuous exhaustion, too, was 
in part the fault of the higher command, which had not 
yet grasped the spirit of modem trench warfare. In a 
short war of movement the officer both can and must 
take it out of his men without regard ; but in a war that 
drags on, this leads to physical collapse. The immense 
number of posts and the continual digging were for the 
most part unnecessary and even harmful. Trenches 
are not the first thing, but the courage and freshness 
of the men behind them. ‘ Battles are won by iron 
hearts in wooden ships.’ 

Certainly in the trenches we heard a few bullets 
whistle, and now and then had a few shells over from 



10 


ORAINVILLE 


the Rheims forts ; but these small experiences of war 
were far beneath our expectations. All the same, we 
were often reminded of the murderous reality that lay 
behind these apparently aimless incidents. For ex¬ 
ample, on the 8th January a shell hit the Fasanerie 
and killed Lieutenant Schmidt, the adjutant of the 
battalion. 

On the 27th January, in honour of the Kaiser, three 
hurrahs rang out, and along the whole length of the 
front ‘ Hail to thee in conqueror’s wreath ’ was sung to 
the accompaniment of the enemy’s rifle-fire. 

During these days I had a most unpleasant experience 
which nearly brought my military career to an untimely 
and inglorious conclusion. The company was on the 
left flank, and towards dawn, after a night entirely with¬ 
out sleep, I and another had to do double sentry-go in 
the low-lying ground. Owing to the cold, I had, 
against orders, thrown my blanket over my head and 
was leaning against a tree. My rifle was resting on a 
bush close beside me. Suddenly there was a noise 
behind me. Out went my hand ... the rifle was gone. 
The officer on duty had slipped up behind me and got 
hold of it without being observed. As a summary 
punishment he sent me armed with a pickaxe towards 
the French posts, about a hundred metres away, 
a Red Indian idea that nearly cost me my life. For 
during the course of my remarkable penalty patrol, a 
patrol of three volunteers crept forward through the 
rushes and was seen and shot at by the French. One, 
called Lang, was hit and never seen again. As I was 
standing close by, I got my share of one of those 
platoon salvoes then so much in favour, and the twigs 



ORAINVILLE 


ii 


of the willow beside me whistled round my ears. I 
clenched my teeth and stood where I was, out of pure 
cussedness. I have never been able to forgive this 
N.C.O.—who soon after was severely wounded and 
got his discharge—for this dirty trick. 

We were all heartily pleased when we heard that we 
were at last to be taken out; and we celebrated our 
departure from Orainville by a tremendous beer-drink¬ 
ing in the huge barn. On the 4th February ’15 we 
were relieved by a Saxon regiment and marched to 
Bazancourt. 

That month, the hardest of the whole war for me, 
was a good schooling all the same. It made me 
thoroughly familiar with the whole round of trench 
duties and fatigues in their severest form. This ex¬ 
perience stood me in good stead later, when without it 
I might as an officer have demanded the impossible 
of my men. 



FROM BAZANCOURT TO 

hattonchAtel 


AT Bazancourt, a dreary little town in Cham- 
ZJk pagne, the company was quartered in the school, 
-A a which, owing to the really surprising feeling for 
order shown by the regiment, very soon had the appear¬ 
ance of a peace-time barracks. There was an orderly 
sergeant to turn us out in the morning, hut fatigue 
and roll-call by sections at night. Every morning we 
marched out for a few hours* drill on the waste and 
untilled fields round about. After a few days I left 
this busy scene of military duties and exercises. I was 
detailed to attend an O.T.C. course at Recouvrence. 

Recouvrence was a remote little village hidden 
among delightful chalk hills. A certain number of 
the more youthful of us were sent there from the 
division to receive a thorough military training from a 
staff of officers and N.C.Os. detailed by each regiment. 
Those of us who came from the 73rd had good reason, 
in connection with this course, to be grateful to Lieu¬ 
tenant Hoppe, an extremely capable officer, who, un¬ 
fortunately, was killed soon after. 

Life in this secluded spot was a strange mixture of 
the rigours of military training and the freedom of 
a university. During the day we were licked into 
military shape in accordance with all the rules of the 
art of war. At night we gathered together with our 
instructors, and in quite as radical a manner emptied 
enormous barrels of beer furnished by the canteen at 



FROM BAZANCOURT TO HATTONCHATEL 13 

Montcomet. When in the early morning hours we 
streamed out from our various messes, the village street 
had the unusual appearance of a students’ Walpurgis 
night. Our C.O., a captain, had, however, the very 
educational habit of taking in hand the duties of the 
day following with redoubled energy. 

Once we were actually kept at it for forty-eight hours 
at a stretch. The reason was this : It was our respect¬ 
ful custom to offer the captain a safe-conduct to his 
billet at the close of a carousal. One evening a god- 
lessly tipsy fellow, a true Simplicius Academicus, who 
always reminded me of Magister Lankard, was en¬ 
trusted with this important duty. He was soon back 
to announce with beams of joy that instead of taking 
the ‘ old ’un * to bed he had accommodated him with 
a stall in a byre. 

Punishment was not long delayed. We had scarcely 
reached our quarters in hopes of a brief repose when 
the alarm sounded. With curses we strapped on our 
equipment and ran to the place appointed. There 
stood the ‘ old ’un 9 waiting for us in as evil a temper as 
can be imagined and displaying an unusual energy. 

He greeted us with the shout, 4 Fire alarm ! The 
guardroom’s on fire ! 9 

Before the eyes of the astonished inhabitants the fire- 
engine was trundled out of its shed and the hose 
screwed on, and the guardroom was then deluged with 
a magnificent stream of water. The ‘ old ’un * stood on 
some stone steps like a grim Jupiter Pluvius and took 
charge of the proceedings, urging us on from above to 
unstinted exertions. Sometimes his thunder broke 
over the head of some soldier or civilian who peculiarly 



14 FROM BAZANCOURT TO HATTONCHATEL 

aroused his anger and he gave the order for him to be 
instantly removed. The unfortunate was hurried with 
all speed behind the nearest house and so removed 
from his sight. When morning dawned we still stood 
with sinking knees at the pump. At last we were dis¬ 
missed to get ready to go on parade. 

When we got to the parade-ground the ‘ old ’un ’ was 
there before us, brisk and spruce, and ready to devote 
himself with peculiar ardour to our instruction. 

We treated the little episode for what it was—a 
cheerful interlude between two acts of war. 

Our intercourse with each other was very free and 
easy, for we all came from the same social class. Three 
or four of us used to live and mess together. I still 
have a grateful memory of the scrambled eggs and fried 
potatoes for supper. On Sundays we had a rabbit or a 
fowl. As I was mess secretary, our landlady laid before 
me a number of chits she had had from requisitioning 
soldiers. The substance of most of them was that 
Fusilier So-and-So had kissed the daughter of the house 
and in return requisitioned twelve eggs. Unfortu¬ 
nately this amusing bouquet, culled from the fields of 
folk-humour, is too obscene to quote from. 

The inhabitants were surprised that common soldiers 
like us all spoke French more or less fluently. Some¬ 
times a comic situation arose from it. I was sitting one 
morning in the village barber’s, with a friend called 
Clement. There were several villagers waiting, and one 
of them said to the barber, who was just setting to work 
on Clement with his razor : ‘Eh, coupez la gorge 
avec ! 9 at the same time drawing his hand across 
his throat. To his consternation Clement replied 



FROM BAZANCOURT TO HATTONCHATEL 15 

quietly: ‘Quant a moi, j’aimerais mieux la garder,’ 
displaying thereby the equanimity that well befits a 
soldier. 

In mid-February we of the 73rd were taken aback by 
the news of the heavy losses our regiment had suffered 
near Perthes, and we regretted having spent those 
days away from our fellows. On the 21st March, after a 
brief examination, we went back to the regiment, which 
was at Bazancourt once more. At this date there was 
a parade and a farewell address by General von Emmick 
on the occasion of our leaving the 10th Corps. On the 
24th March we were entrained and conveyed to the 
neighbourhood of Brussels, and there we were brigaded 
with the 76th and the 164th in the mth Infantry 
Division. 

Our battalion was quartered in Hfrinnes (Flemish : 
Herne), a small town in a pleasant Flemish countryside, 
and here on the 29th March I spent a very happy 
twentieth birthday. 

Though the Belgians had plenty of room in their 
houses, our company was, from false scruples, stuck in 
a great draughty bam, with the raw sea winds of that 
district blowing through it in those cold March nights. 
It was always : * Belgium must not be treated as the 
enemy’s country,’ That was a very natural considera¬ 
tion to show; but when once the military necessity 
of marching through it had been accepted, it was 
absurd to boggle over the petty consequences. It is 
in a war more important than may perhaps be thought 
that the men should sometimes have beds to sleep in. 
And when no beds are empty, then some must be 
emptied. The soldier must have the first considers-

tion. We sometimes made ourselves ridiculous with 
our misplaced human kindness, and might well have 
taken more care of our dignity. 

The population, half Flemish and half Walloon, was 
very friendly towards us. I had many talks with the 
owner of an estaminet, a keen socialist and freethinker, 
who invited me to celebrate Easter Sunday with him, 
and even refused payment for what I drank. Such 
encounters are almost unbelievably welcome and bene¬ 
ficial after the rough companionship of the ranks. 

Towards the end of our time there the weather was 
fine, and tempted us to go for walks in the delightful and 
well-watered country round. The scene was made the 
more picturesque by the many naked figures seated all 
along the poplar-fringed stream with their laundry on 
their knees, engaged in a zealous hunt for lice. 

As I had so far been more or less free from this 
plague, I assisted a friend, Priepke, to deal with his 
woollen vest, which was as populous as the habit of 
Simplicius Simplicissimus of yore. So we wrapped 
it round a large stone and sank it in a stream. As 
our departure from Herne followed very suddenly 
upon this, it is likely that the garment enjoys a quiet 
resting-place there to this day. 

On the 12th of April 1915 we entrained at Hal, and, 
to defeat the spies, were taken by way of the north wing 
of the front to the neighbourhood of the battlefield of 
Mars-la-Tour. The company had their customary 
barn quarters in the village of Trouville, one of the 
usual squalid hamlets of Lorraine, whose flat-roofed, 
windowless houses look like a lot of stone boxes thrown 
together in a heap. On account of the danger from air- 



FROM BAZANCOURT TO HATTONCHATEL 17 

craft we had to keep ourselves close in the overcrowded 
place. In the neighbourhood are the famous fields of 
Mars-la-Tours and Gravelotte. A few hundred metres 
from the village the road from the frontier to Gravelotte 
was cut and the French boundary-post lay smashed on 
the ground. In the evenings we often had the melancholy 
satisfaction of a walk over the boundary to Germany. 

Our barn was so ruinous that we had to pick our way 
with care over what remained of the boarded floor, or 
else we found ourselves on the ground underneath. 

One evening, as our platoon was busied, under the 
presidency of our esteemed corporal, Kerkhoff, in 
dividing out our rations on a manger, one of the huge 
oak beams of the timber roof came crashing down. By 
good fortune it caught between two cob-walls just above 
our heads. We got off with the fright, but our beauti¬ 
ful ration of meat disappeared for good beneath a 
shower of rubble. We had scarcely settled down again 
after this ominous disaster when there was a thundering 
knock at the door and the voice of the sergeant-major 
warned us to fall in. At first, as always on such 
occasions, there was a moment’s silence. Then a 
regular stirabout: ‘ My helmet! where’s my haver¬ 
sack ? I can’t get my boots on ! You’ve got hold of 
my cartridges ! Oh, shut up ! 9 

Finally, however, all was ship-shape and we marched 
to the railway station of Chamblay, whence we were 
conveyed in a few minutes to Pagny-sur-Moselle. In 
the early morning we climbed the heights above the 
Moselle and came to a halt in Pr&iy, a romantic hill 
village, surmounted by the ruins of a castle. This time 
our bam was a stone one filled with scented mountain

hay, and through its window slits we looked out on the 
vineclad slopes of the Moselle and the little town of 
Pagny in the valley, which was often shelled and 
bombed. Sometimes a shot hit the Moselle and flung 
up a great column of water. 

The warm weather and the magnificent country 
worked on us like magic, and we went for long walks 
whenever we had time off. We were in such high 
spirits that at night we had to indulge in ragging before 
we could settle down to sleep. A favourite game, 
among others, was pouring water or coffee into the open 
mouths of the snorers. 

On the evening of the 22nd April we left Preny, 
and after a march of over thirty kilometres reached 
the village of Hattonchatel without a single man 
falling out, and this with full pack. We pitched tents 
in the forest on the right of the famous Grande 
Tranchee. Everything pointed to our being put into 
the fighting on the following day. Field dressings, 
second tins of bully, and artillery flag signals were 
given out. 

At night, in that mood of foreboding known to soldiers 
of every time, I sat a long while on the stump of a tree 
overgrown with blue anemones, before I crept over the 
others to my bed in the tent; and that night I had a 
confused dream in which a death’s-head played the 
leading part. Priepke, to whom I told it in the morn¬ 
ing, hoped the skull was a French one. 



LES EPARGES 


T HE young green of the woods shone in the 
morning light. We went by concealed ways 
to a narrow gorge behind the front line. It 
had been given out that the 76 th Regiment was 
attacking after twenty minutes’ artillery preparation, 
and that we were to stand by in reserve. 

Precisely at 12 noon our artillery began a violent 
bombardment that echoed and re-echoed through 
the forest gorges. It was here we understood for 
the first time that dreaded word, drum-fire. We sat 
on our knapsacks and waited in suspense. An orderly 
dashed up to the company commander. Hurried 
words. ‘ The three first lines are in our hands. Six 
guns captured. ’ We broke into a cheer and the spirit 
of the offensive woke in us. 

At last came the longed-for orders and we moved off 
in file in the direction of the faint crackling of rifle-fire. 
It was war. 

Beside the path in a dense plantation of firs there 
were dull crumps, and earth and twigs came showering 
down. The laughter was a trifle forced when one of 
us, overcome by his nerves, flung himself on the ground. 
Then the warning cry of death came flitting along the 
ranks from in front, ‘ Stretcher forward! ’ 

Soon we passed the point where we had broken 
through. The wounded had already been sent back. 
Blood-stained fragments of equipment and flesh were 
caught on the bushes all round ... a strange and

oppressive sight that made me think of the red-backed 
shrike that spits its prey on the thorns. 

The Grande Tranchee was full of troops hastening 
forward. Wounded men implored water and cowered 
against the wall of the trench, prisoners carrying 
stretchers went panting rearwards, chargers careered 
madly through the fire. On every side shells churned 
the soft ground. Heavy branches fell to earth. Right 
in our way lay a dead horse with gaping wounds and, 
beside it, smoking entrails. A bearded Landwehrsman 
leaned against a tree. * Boys, now for it. The French 
are on the run.’ 

We were in the battle-tossed empire of the infantry. 
In a circle all round the break-through, the artillery 
fire had made a clean sweep of the trees. On the 
tortured ground lay the dead and dying that the attack 
had cost us, their faces towards the enemy and their grey 
coats scarcely visible against the ground. A gigantic 
fellow whose red beard was smeared with blood stared 
into the sky, his fingers clutching the loose soil. 
Another, younger, lying in a shell-hole, stirred and 
turned over. The sallowness of death was already on 
his face. He did not seem to like our looking at him. 
With a listless movement he drew his cloak over his 
head and lay still. 

From here we went on in file. Shells were scream¬ 
ing over all the time. Where they struck there was a 
flash and the soil of the clearing was whirled aloft. 
* Stretcher-bearers ! ’ We had our first casualty. A 
shrapnel bullet had severed Fusilier Stoller’s carotid 
artery. Three bandages were saturated instantly, and 
within a few seconds he had bled to death. Near by

were two guns that could not keep quiet and drew on 
us even heavier fire. A gunner lieutenant, who was 
looking for wounded, was knocked over in a column 
of smoke that went up at his feet. He picked himself 
up with marked composure and came slowly back. 
We were greatly impressed. 

It was getting dusk when orders came to advance. 
We went by an endless communication trench through 
thick undergrowth much wrecked and tom by shell-fire. 
The trench was strewn with kit and equipment thrown 
down by the flying French. Near Les Eparges we had to 
dig ourselves in in rocky ground, for there were no other 
troops in front of us. At last I sank down into a bush 
and fell asleep. Often as I dozed I could see high over¬ 
head the shells of some artillery or other describe their 
ellipses in a train of sparks. 

‘ Here, get up, you ! We ’re moving forward.’ I 
woke on grass wet with dew. As we were swept with 
machine-gun fire, we made haste back into our com¬ 
munication trench again and took possession of an 
abandoned French position on the outskirts of the 
forest. My attention was caught by a sickly smell and 
a bundle hanging on the wire. Jumping out of the 
trench in the early morning mist, I found myself in 
front of a huddled-up corpse, a Frenchman. The 
putrid flesh, like the flesh of fishes, gleamed greenish- 
white through the rents in the uniform. I turned away 
and then started back in horror : close to me a figure 
cowered beside a tree. It wore the shining straps and 
belt of the French, and high upon its back there was 
still the loaded pack, crowned with a round cooking 
utensil. Empty eye-sockets and the few wisps of hair

on the black and weathered skull told me that this was 
no living man. Another sat with the upper part of the 
body clapped down over the legs as though broken 
through the middle. All round lay dozens of corpses, 
putrefied, calcined, mummified, fixed in a ghastly dance 
of death. The French must have carried on for 
months without burying their fallen comrades. 

Before midday the sun broke through the mist and 
sent out a pleasing warmth. After I had slept for a bit 
on the floor of the trench I walked along its deserted 
bays. Taken by the attack of the day before, it was 
heaped high with mountains of provisions, munitions, 
equipment, weapons, and newspapers. The dugouts 
resembled plundered pawnbrokers* shops. Here and 
there lay the bodies of those who had fallen at their 
posts ; their rifles were still on the parapet. A trunk 
with head and neck shot away was clipped in among 
some riven woodwork. White cartilage shone out 
from the red and blackened flesh. 

It was hard to understand. Near-by a young fellow 
lay on his back, his glazed eyes and his fingers fixed in 
their last aim. It was a weird sensation to look into 
those dead and questioning eyes. It gave me a shudder 
that all through the war I never quite lost. His pockets 
were turned inside out, and beside him lay his pitiful 
plundered purse. . . . 

Although I made up my mind to omit all comments 
from this book, 1 I should like all the same to say a 
word or two about this first glimpse of horrors. It is 

1 Its aim is to deal with the experience of war purely. I have 
attempted to deal with its psychology in another work. (War as 
an Inward Experience , E. S. Mittler & Son, Berlin.)

a moment so important in the experience of war. The 
horrible was undoubtedly a part of that irresistible 
attraction that drew us into the war. A long period 
of law and order, such as our generation had behind it, 
produces a real craving for the abnormal, a craving that 
literature stimulates. Among other questions that 
occupied us was this : what does it look like when there 
are dead lying about ? And we never for a moment 
dreamt that in this war the dead would be left month 
after month to the mercy of wind and weather, as once 
the bodies on the gallows were. 

And now at our first glance of horror we had a feeling 
that is difficult to describe. Seeing and recognizing 
are matters, really, of habit. In the case of something 
quite unknown the eye alone can make nothing of it. 
So it was that we had to stare again and again at these 
things that we had never seen before, without being 
able to give them any meaning. It was too entirely 
unfamiliar. We looked at all these dead with dis¬ 
located limbs, distorted faces, and the hideous colours 
of decay, as though we walked in a dream through a 
garden full of strange plants, and we could not realize 
at first what we had all round us. But finally we were 
so accustomed to the horrible that if we came on a dead 
body anywhere on a fire-step or in a ditch we gave it 
no more than a passing thought and recognized it as 
we would a stone or a tree. . . . 

I strolled along the devastated trench without being 
troubled by enemy fire. It was the brief respite 
before mid-day that often on many a battlefield I 
learned to welcome as a breathing-space. I used this 
time now to have a look at everything quietly and com- 



24 


LES EPARGES 


fortably. The enemy accoutrements, the darkness of 
the dugouts, the miscellaneous contents of the haver¬ 
sacks, everything was new and puzzling. I put French 
cartridges in my pockets, unbuckled a silk-soft ground- 
sheet, and carried off a water-bottle covered with blue 
cloth, and after three steps threw all away again. I was 
induced by a fine striped shirt, lying near an officer’s 
ransacked valise, to pull off my uniform and change my 
linen, and I was delighted by the fresh, clean feel on my 
skin. In those days no one imagined going on leave 
during a war or being able to have a change of clothes. 
We fought till we were wounded, and wore the old shirt 
till the acquisition of a new one allowed us to throw it 
away. It was the length of the war that drove us back 
at last to humdrum ways. Even Colonel von Oppen, 
who had sworn a mighty oath that there were three 
things he would never do during the campaign— 
have his beard trimmed, change his patched cloak for 
a new one, or take a pen in his hand—had at last to 
forswear himself. 

Now that I was rigged out afresh, I looked for a sunny 
nook in the trench and, sitting on a piece of timber, I 
opened a round tin of beef and had lunch. Then I lit 
a pipe and read the numerous French newspapers lying 
all round. Most of them, as I saw from the date, had 
been sent into the trenches the day before from Verdun, 

Visibility was now good, and a German battery in a 
small wood just behind the trench began firing. It was 
not long before the enemy made the appropriate 
answer. Suddenly I was frightened out of my wits by 
a mighty crash behind me, and a cone of smoke rose 
high up in the air. Unused as I still was to the multiple 






LES EPARGES 


25 

din of the war, I was not able to disentangle the whistle 
and hum of our own guns from the rending crash of the 
enemy shells that fell with ever briefer pauses. And 
what puzzled me most of all was why it went on from 
all sides, as though the whizzing shells crossed each 
others’ paths in a senseless maze above the maze of 
little trenches in which we were dispersed. I could see 
no occasion for all this activity, and it disturbed and 
puzzled me. I was still without experience of the 
fighting, and saw it as a recruit. The battle seemed to 
me to proceed as strangely and disconnectedly as 
though it went on upon another planet. At the same 
time I had no fear. For I felt that I was not seen, and 
I could not believe that any one aimed at me or that I 
should be hit. Indeed, when I rejoined my section I 
surveyed our front with complete calm. It was the 
courage of ignorance. 

Towards mid-day the artillery fire rose to a wild 
dance. It broke round us without a pause. White, 
black, and yellow smoke mingled their clouds. The 
shells with black smoke, called ‘ Americans ’ or 4 coal- 
boxes ’ by the old soldiers, exploded with a fearful 
detonation. In between one heard the familiar twitter¬ 
ing of the falling fuses, like the song of canaries. It 
was odd that the birds in the forest did not appear to be 
in the least put out by this hundredfold clatter. They 
sat peacefully above the swathes of smoke in the 
shattered branches, and in the brief intervals of silence 
we could hear their love-calls and untroubled songs. 
Indeed, it seemed that they were urged on to sing by 
the sea of noise that tossed around them. 

I sat with another man on a bench fixed into the wall 



26 


LES EPARGES 


of the trench. Once there was a report on the boarded 
loophole through which we were looking, and a rifle 
bullet passed between our heads and plunged into 
the soil. 

We were having casualties all the time. I could not 
tell what went on in the other parts of the trench, 
but the constant call for stretchers showed that the 
shelling was beginning to take effect. Now and then 
some one hurried by with a fresh white bandage that 
shone out on head or neck or hand, and disappeared 
to the rear. According to the superstition of the 
trenches, there was no time to be lost in getting safely 
out of it with a light wound, as it was often the fore¬ 
runner of a serious one. 

My comrade, a volunteer named Kohl, displayed 
that North German cold-bloodedness which seems 
peculiarly designed for such situations. He bit and 
squeezed at a cigar that never after all would burn, and 
he looked very sleepy. His composure was not dis¬ 
turbed when suddenly there were reports as of a 
thousand rifles behind us. The shell-fire had ignited 
the forest, and huge flames climbed crackling up the 
trees. 

At this moment a man appeared at the corner of our 
fire-bay and told us to follow on to the left. We did so, 
through clouds of smoke. It was the ration party, 
just got back, and hundreds of abandoned pots and pans 
were cooking on the parapet. 

Who could eat now ? A crowd of wounded with 
blood-soaked bandages pressed on past us, showing 
the state of their nerves in their white faces. Above, 
all along the edge of the trench, stretcher after stretcher

passed along quickly to the rear. The feeling that we 
were in a tight corner began to take hold of us. ‘ Look 
out for my arm ! ’ ‘ Look alive, man; keep touch ! ’ 

The trench ended in a wood. We stood aimlessly 
under giant beeches. Our company commander, a 
lieutenant, came up through the undergrowth and 
called for the senior N.C.O. * Swarm out and take 
up a line facing west. Then report to me in the 
dugout in the clearing.’ With a curse the N.C.O. 
took over. 

The impression made on the men by this occurrence 
was a standing lesson to me during the whole time I was 
in command myself. Later I got to know this officer, 
who distinguished himself on many occasions, and I 
learned that matters of importance had detained him. 
All the same, an officer should never be parted from his 
men in the moment of danger on any account whatever. 
Danger is the supreme moment of his career, his chance 
to show his manhood at its best. Honour and gallantry 
make him the master of the hour. What is more 
sublime than to face death at the head of a hundred 
men ? Such a one will never find obedience fail him, 
for courage runs through the ranks like wine. 

We deployed and, wondering what to expect, took 
cover in a row of flat pockets hollowed out by some 
predecessor or other. We were calling out to each 
other and joking, when we were cut short by a noise that 
shook us to the marrow. Twenty metres behind us 
clods of earth were whirled through a cloud of white 
smoke and rattled through the tree tops. Time after 
time the explosions rolled through the forest. With 
glazed eyes we stared at one another, and our bodies 



LES EPARGES 


28 

clove to the earth in utter impotence and prostration. 
Shell followed shell. Suffocating gases hung in the 
undergrowth, dense vapour wrapped the tree tops, trees 
and branches came crashing to the ground, loud cries 
rang out. We jumped up and ran wildly, hunted by 
lightnings and stunned by rushes of air. We ran from 
tree to tree seeking cover and chasing round the great 
trunks like hunted game. A dugout into which many 
ran got a direct hit that sent the heavy timber sky-high. 

With the N.C.O. I ran panting to a mighty beech, 
like a squirrel pursued with stones. Automatically, 
and starting back at one shell-burst after another, I ran 
on after him, while he turned round now and again and 
stared at me with wild eyes and shouted : 4 What about 
these ones, eh ? what about these ? ’ 

Suddenly there was a flash among the interlacing 
roots, and a blow against my left thigh threw me to the 
ground. I thought I had been hit by a lump of earth. 
Then I saw from the stream of blood that I was 
wounded. Later I discovered that a splinter as fine as a 
hair had given me a flesh wound after expending its 
force on my purse. The shaving cut from the thick 
leather was as thin as a sheet of paper. 

I threw down my pack and ran to the trench we had 
left. From all sides the wounded converged upon it 
out of the shell-swept wood. The trench was frightful. 
It was blocked with severely wounded and dying men. 
One, stripped to the waist and with torn sides, leant 
against the trench wall. Another, from the back of 
whose head a triangular rent hung down, uttered 
piercing, agonizing cries without ceasing. . . .And still 
shell upon shell. 






LES EPARGES 


29 


My nerve broke down utterly. Without regard for 
any one I ran anyhow through the throng, and at last, 
falling back once or twice in my haste, climbed up out 
of the hellish tumult of the trench so as to have free 
passage in the open. I tore along like a bolting horse 
through the thick undergrowth, across tracks and 
clearings, till at length I found myself in a part of the 
wood near the Grande Tranche. 

Close by was a dressing-station, a dugout covered 
with branches. Here I spent the night among'a crowd 
of other wounded. A worn-out doctor stood in the 
midst of groaning men, bandaging, injecting, and giving 
directions in a quiet voice. I pulled the cloak of one of 
the dead over me and fell into a deep sleep, disturbed 
by strange and feverish dreams. I woke once in the 
middle of the night and saw the doctor still at work by 
the light of a lantern. A Frenchman uttered every 
moment a piercing yell, and near me some one grumbled 
irritably : 4 Just like a Frenchman ! Oh, well, if they 
couldn’t yell they wouldn’t be happy.’ Then I fell 
asleep again. 

When I was being carried out next morning a splinter 
bored a hole through the canvas of the stretcher between 
my knees. I was taken across the Grande Tranch^e, 
which was still heavily bombarded, to the chief dressing- 
station, and then moved into the church of the village 
of St. Maurice. Near me in the jolting ambulance lay 
a man with an abdominal wound who implored his 
comrades to shoot him with the orderly’s revolver. 

A hospital train stood under steam in St. Maurice 
Station, and in two days we reached Heidelberg. As I 
saw the slopes above the Neckar wreathed in cherry

blossom I felt a vivid pang of home-sickness. How 
beautiful a country, worth bleeding for and dying for ! 

The battle of Les Eparges was the first I was in, and 
it was not at all what I had expected. I had taken part 
in a great military operation without coming within 
sight of the enemy. It was later that I experienced 
hand-to-hand fighting, that supreme moment of war¬ 
fare when the infantryman comes into the open and 
when the chaotic vacancy of the battlefield has its 
murderous and decisive interludes.

M Y wound was healed in fourteen days. I 
was sent to the reserve battalion at Hanover, 
and reported there as a cadet. After going 
through a course at Doberitz and getting further pro¬ 
motion, I went back to the regiment in September 

* 9 * 5 - 

I left the train at St. Leger, the headquarters of the 
division, and marched with a detachment of recruits to 
Douchy, the headquarters of the regiment. On our 
front the autumn offensive was in full swing. Over a 
wide stretch of country the front line was marked by a 
swaying cloud of smoke. Over our heads were aero¬ 
planes and the tac-tac-tac of their Lewis guns. Appar¬ 
ently we were spotted from a captive balloon, for at the 
entrance of the village the smoke of a bomb rose in a 
black cone in front of us. I turned aside and led the 
column into the village by another route. 

Douchy, the headquarters of the 73rd, was a village 
of moderate size, and had not so far suffered a great deal 
from the war. It lies in the undulating country of 
Artois, and during our year and a half’s fighting in this 
part of the front it served us as a second depot and as 
a rest-place where we could recuperate after hard times 
in the front line. How often we heaved a sigh of relief 
at the sight of a lonely light gleaming on a wet night at 
the entrance of the village ! There one had at any rate 
a roof over one’s head and an undisturbed nook of one’s 
own. One could sleep without having to turn out

every four hours and without being pursued even in 
one's dreams by the constant expectation of a raid. 
The first day of rest was like being born anew, when 
after a bath one puts on clean clothes and well-brushed 
uniform. There were drill and games on the fields 
about, to loosen the joints and awaken a sense of com¬ 
radeship among men who had spent the long and lonely 
nights on guard. From this we got fresh zest for new 
and arduous days. At first the companies used to 
march up in turn to the front every night. This 
exhausting double shift was later given up by order 
of Colonel von Oppen, who showed in this his habitual 
commonsense. The security of a position depends on 
the freshness of its defenders and their fighting spirit, 
not on the length of the communication trenches and 
the depth of the firing line. 

Douchy had many innocent recreations to offer us. 
There were numerous canteens well provided with 
eatables and drinks. There was a reading-room, a cafe, 
and later even a cinema in a large barn most skilfully 
converted. The officers had a splendidly-equipped 
casino and a skittle-alley in the vicarage garden. Often 
companies held festive evenings at which officers and 
men vied with each other in drinking in the good old 
German style. 

As the civil population still lived in the village, all 
the space available had to be made full use of. The 
gardens were partly occupied with huts and temporary 
dwellings of one sort and another ; a large orchard in 
the centre of the village was used for church parade ; 
another was made into a pleasure-garden and called the 
Emmich Platz. Here in huts covered with branches

were the barber and the dentist, A large meadow near 
the church served as a burial-ground. Nearly every 
day one company or another marched there to bury 
one or more of their number. 

Thus in the course of a year the buildings appropriate 
to a garrison town overgrew the dilapidated village like 
a mighty parasite. The peaceful picture was scarcely 
recognizable. Dragoons watered their horses in the 
village pond, infantry training went on in the gardens, 
and all over the meadows soldiers lay and sunned them¬ 
selves. Nothing was kept up that did not serve a 
military purpose, and all that did was in perfect order. 
Hedges and fences were broken down or removed 
altogether to give better communications, while, on the 
other hand, at every corner there were huge signposts, 
shining and resplendent. While roofs fell in and all 
that was burnable went by degrees for fuel, the tele¬ 
phone and electric light were installed. The cellars 
were used as the starting-points for deep dugouts so 
that the occupants of the houses could have shelter 
during bombardments, and the spoil was heaped cal¬ 
lously in the gardens. A political economist could 
have studied here a small working model of the Com¬ 
munist state, for in the whole village there were no 
boundaries and no personal possessions. 

The French inhabitants were in huts on the outskirts 
of the village towards Monchy. They were mostly 
timid, pitiful figures who had suffered bitterly from 
the war. Children played without a thought on the 
threshold of the ruinous houses, and old men went with 
bent heads through the busy scenes that with brutal 
ruthlessness made the place where they had lived their 

c

lives no longer recognizable. The young people had 
to present themselves every morning before Lieutenant 
Oberlander, the town-major, whose rule was a strict 
one, in order to have their tasks allotted them in the 
cultivation of the land within the village boundaries. 
We only came in contact with the natives when we took 
our clothes to be washed or bought eggs and butter. 
Intimate relations were very rare. Love had no place 
in this stark and devastating machinery. 

There were two French boys, orphans, one eight, the 
other twelve years old, who became attached to the 
troops in the most extraordinary way. They wore 
nothing but field grey, spoke fluent German, and saluted 
all officers in the prescribed manner. They spoke of 
their fellow-countrymen contemptuously and called 
them ‘ Schangels * as they heard the soldiers doing. Their 
great desire was to go into the line with their company. 
They were proficient in drill and fell in on the left of the 
company at roll-call, and when they wished to accom¬ 
pany the canteen orderlies on an expedition to buy 
provisions at Cambrai they duly asked for leave. When 
the and Battalion went to Queant for a few weeks’ 
training, one of the two, called Louis, was, by order of 
Colonel von Oppen, to remain behind in Douchy, so 
that no occasion for false reports should be given to the 
civil population. During the march he was nowhere to 
be seen, but when the battalion arrived he jumped out of 
one of the transport waggons, where he had hidden him¬ 
self. Unfortunately,some of the more thoughtless of the 
men used to take them with them into the canteen for the 
amusement of teaching them to drink. Later, I believe, 
the elder was sent to a N.C.O. course in Germany.

Scarcely an hour by road from Douchy lay Monchy- 
au-Bois, the village where the two companies in reserve 
were quartered. This place was the occasion of bitter 
fighting in the autumn of 1914. At length it remained 
in German hands, and the fighting came to a standstill 
in a shallow ellipse round the ruins of the once pros¬ 
perous place. The houses were now burnt and shot 
to bits. The waste gardens were churned up by shells 
and the fruit trees split and riven. The wilderness of 
stone had been adapted for defence by trenches, 
barbed wire, barricades, and concrete emplacements. 
The streets could all be swept with machine-gun fire 
from a central concrete emplacement, the Torgau Re¬ 
doubt. There was another, the Altenburg Redoubt, 
an entrenched post on the right of the village, which 
concealed one platoon of the reserve company. There 
was a quarry out of which in times of peace limestone 
had been got for building, and this was an important 
part of the defences. It had been discovered only by 
chance. A company cook, whose bucket had fallen 
into a well of spring water, went down after it and dis¬ 
covered a hole that seemed to connect with a large 
cave. The matter was looked into, and a second 
entrance was broken through into a bomb-proof refuge 
that held a considerable body of men. 

On the lonely hill on the road to Ransart there was 
a ruin that once had been an estaminet. It was called 
Bellevue because of the extensive view from there over 
the front. In spite of its danger it had great attrac¬ 
tions for me. The eye could travel for miles over the 
ruined landscape, whose dead villages were connected 
by roads where no vehicle moved and no living being 



36 DOUCHY AND MONCHY 

was to be seen. Further back were the faint outlines 
of Arras, the forsaken city, and further to the right 
gleamed the chalk-mine craters of St. Eloi. The 
waste and overgrown fields, with great cloud shadows 
flitting over them, checkered and crossed the network 
of trenches with yellow lines. Only here and there 
the smoke of a shell wavered up, as though propelled 
by a ghostly hand, and fluttered loose in the air ; or 
the ball of a shrapnel hovered over the desert land like 
a great flock of wool, and slowly dissolved away. The 
face of the earth was dark and fabulous, for the war 
had expunged the pleasant features of the country¬ 
side and engraved there its own iron lines that in 
a lonely hour made the spectator shudder. 

The forlornness and the profound silence, broken 
now and then by the deep tones of the guns, 
were emphasized by the sad marks of devastation. 
Torn packs, broken rifles, pieces of equipment, and 
among them, in grim contrast, a child’s plaything ; 
shell fuses, deep shell-holes, water-bottles, torn books, 
broken utensils, holes whose mysterious darkness 
suggests a cellar in which, perhaps, the bones of the 
unfortunate tenant have been gnawed clean by the 
never idle swarms of rats ; a peach-tree, whose support¬ 
ing wall has gone, stretching out its branches for help, 
the skeletons of the domestic animals still tied by their 
heads in their stalls, trenches cut through the deserted 
gardens where, smothered among weeds, are seen 
onions, wormwood, rhubarb, and daffodils ; in the 
neighbouring fields stacks through whose thatch the 
corn is shooting; and all this traversed by a half- 
obliterated communication trench and scented by the 



DOUGHY AND MONCHY 37 

odour of burning and decay. The soldier who walks 
among the ruins of a place like this and thinks of those 
who lately lived their peaceful lives there, may well be 
overtaken by sad reflections. 

The line, as I said above, ran in a narrow half-circle 
round the village, with which it was connected by a 
number of communication trenches. Our front was 
divided into two segments, Monchy South and Monchy 
West. These were again subdivided into the six 
company sectors A to F. The circular form of the 
position offered the English an excellent opportunity 
of flanking fire, and they made good use of it, inflicting 
heavy losses. 

I was sent to the 6th Company, and went into the 
line a few days after my arrival, as a section 
leader. An unpleasant welcome awaited me, owing 
to English 4 toffee-apples.’ C sector, held by the 6th 
Company, was the most exposed of the whole of our 
front. Our company commander at that time was 
Lieutenant R. Brecht, who had hurried across from 
America at the outbreak of the war, and a better man 
for the defence of such a position could not be found. 
His fighting spirit was never behindhand, and it 
brought him at last a glorious death. 

Our life in the trenches passed very methodic¬ 
ally. The following is the description of a normal 
day. 

A day in the front line begins at dusk. At seven a 
member of my section wakes me from the afternoon 
sleep in which I have indulged in view of trench 
duty at night. I buckle on my belt, stick a Verey-light 
pistol in it and some bombs, and leave my more or 



DOUCHY AND MONCHY 


38 

less comfortable shelter. A first patrol of the familiar 
section of the trench assures me that all posts are 
properly manned. The password is exchanged in a 
low voice. Meanwhile night has fallen, and the first 
Verey lights have taken their silver course up the sky. 
Eyes stare intently along our front. A rat rustles 
among the jam tins thrown over the top. A second 
joins it with a squeak, and soon the scene is alive with 
flitting shadows that stream from the ruined cellars 
or disused dugouts of the village. Rat-hunts are a 
favourite diversion in the dreary round of trench duty. 
A piece of bread is laid as a bait and a rifle carefully 
sighted on it, or the explosive is taken from the duds, 
strewn in their holes, and ignited, till, with shrill 
squeaks, their singed bodies are shot forth. Repul¬ 
sive, nauseous creatures! Their rustling multitudes 
carry with them a penetrating effluvium, and I can 
never help thinking of their secret doings among the 
dead in the cellars of the village. 

A few cats, too, have been drawn to the trenches 
from the destroyed villages in search of human com¬ 
pany. A large white tom-cat, with one forepaw shot 
off, was a frequent ghostly visitant of No-man’s-land, 
and seemed to be on terms with both sides. 

But I was speaking of trench duty. Such distrac¬ 
tions are welcome ; and it is easy to be talkative, if 
only to fill in the endless hours of darkness. That is 
why I, too, have stopped beside one of the men, a 
veteran of many scraps, or another N.C.O., and drink 
in with rapt interest all the little nothings he can 
tell me. As N.C.O, it is often my fortune in turn 
to be led into amiable talk with the officer on duty, 



DOUCHY AND MONCHY 


39 


who feels a bit lonely himself. He will even talk to 
me like a brother, and in a low and earnest voice pour 
out all his hopes and secrets. Nor am I behindhand, 
for the pressure of the hard black walls of the trench 
weighs on me too, and I have a longing for a little 
warmth and something human in all this unnatural 
loneliness. 

The talk flags. We are tired out. Phlegmatically 
we stand in a fire-bay, leaning against the trench and 
staring at the glow of each other’s cigarettes. . . . 

In frost, one tramps freezing to and fro, and the hard 
ground rings with all the foot-beats. Very often it 
is raining. Then with upturned collar one stands 
under the penthouse entrance of a deep dugout and 
watches the monotonous descent of the drops. Sup¬ 
pose the step of a superior officer is heard approaching 
along the sopping trench. One leaps out, of course, 
and going a little further on whips suddenly round, 
and saluting with a crack of the heels, reports * Sergeant 
on duty. All in order in the trench.’ For standing 
in the dugout entrances is forbidden. 

The thoughts go wool-gathering. One looks at the 
moon and thinks of snug and happy days at home, or 
of the great town far away behind where at this moment 
people are streaming from the cafes, and where the 
chief streets, with their busy night life, are brightly 
lit with arc lamps. It seems as though one must have 
dreamed all that ages ago. 

Then something rustles in front of the trench. 
There is a sound of wire clinking. In a second every 
dream is shattered and the senses are sharpened till 
they hurt. You clamber on to the fire-step and let off 



40 


DOUCHY AND MONCHY 


a Verey light. Not a sound nor a sign. It must have 
been a partridge, or a hare. 

Often one hears the enemy at work on his wire. At 
once shot after shot is fired in the direction of the 
sounds, and not only because such are the orders, but 
because there’s a certain satisfaction in it. We, too, 
take out wire nearly every night, and have many casual¬ 
ties doing it. Then we curse the beastly swine the 
English. 

Then, perhaps, there’s a whistling, whispering 
noise following upon a dull report. ‘ Trench mortar 
over 1 * 

You rush for the nearest dugout steps and hold your 
breath. Trench-mortar bombs explode with a very 
different and far worse noise than shells. There’s 
something rending about them and treacherous, and 
something personally malignant. They ’re insidious 
beasts, and rifle-grenades are not much better. As 
soon as there are flashes from a particular spot behind 
the enemy front, all the posts leave the fire-steps and 
vanish. They know exactly from long experience 
where the guns are that are directed upon Section C. 

At last the phosphorescent figures of your watch 
show that two hours have gone by. So you wake your 
relief without delay and get back to the dugout. Per¬ 
haps the ration party has brought letters or a parcel or 
a newspaper. It is a quite remarkable feeling to read 
the news from home and all its peaceful concerns while 
the shadow of the flickering candle flits to and fro 
across the low, rough timbering overhead. After I have 
scraped the worst of the mud from my boots with a bit 
of wood and given them a finishing touch on one of the 








DOUCHY AND MONCHY 41 

legs of the primitive table, I lie down on the plank bed 
and pull my blanket over my head to enjoy four hours 
of sleep. Outside, the shots strike the parapet in 
wearisome iteration. A mouse flits over my face and 
hands without disturbing my sleep. I am left in peace 
even by smaller beasts, for the dugout was thoroughly 
disinfected only a few days ago. 

I am torn from sleep twice more to take my turn of 
duty. During the last spell a light streak behind us in 
the eastern sky heralds the new day. The contours of 
the trench show up more sharply, and the impression 
made by the dawning light is one of unspeakable 
desolation. 

A lark soars up. I feel that its trills underline the 
situation too obtrusively, and I am annoyed. Leaning 
on the parapet, I stare at the strip of ground in front 
bounded by our wire in a mood of utter disenchantment. 
Surely these last twenty minutes might come to an end ! 
At last there is a rattle of the dixies as the party sent for 
the coffee comes back along the communication trench. 
It is seven o’clock and the round of night guards is 
ended. 

I go into the dugout and drink some coffee and have 
a wash in a Bismarck herring-tin. I am so cheered up 
that the wish to lie down again has deserted me. And 
at nine I have to allot my section its tasks and set it 
to work. We are regular Jacks-of-all-trades, and every 
day the care of the trench makes its thousand claims 
on us. We sink deep shafts, construct dugouts and 
concreted posts, get wire entanglements ready, lay out 
drainage schemes, revet, prop, level, heighten, chamfer, 
and fill in latrines. In short, out of our resources we 



DOUCHY AND MONCHY 


42 

apply ourselves to every trade. And why not ? What 
one can’t do,another can. Not long since a miner took 
the pick from my hand as I was at work on our platoon 
dugout and said : * Keep getting it out below, sir. 

It ’ll fall down of itself from on top ! ’ 

Fancy not having known such a simple thing as that 
all this while ! But here, planted down in the middle 
of the empty waste where there’s the sudden and un¬ 
answerable compulsion of seeking shelter from shot 
and shell and wind and weather, of carpentering beds 
and tables, of building hearths and stairs, a man soon 
learns to use his hands. He sees the value of the handi¬ 
crafts. 

At one o’clock dinner is brought up the line in large 
vessels that once were milk-cans and jam-drums, from 
the kitchen in a cellar at Monchy. After dinner . . . 
a little sleep or reading while gradually the two hours’ 
daily trench duty draws nearer. They pass a great deal 
more quickly than those of the night. One observes 
the well-known enemy position through field-glasses 
or periscope, and often gets a shot at a head target with 
the help of the latter. But caution is necessary, for the 
English too have sharp eyes and good glasses. 

One of a post suddenly collapses in a stream of blood, 
shot in the head. His fellows tear the field-dressing 
from his tunic and bind him up. 

1 There’s no use in doing that now, Wilhelm.’ 

* He’s still breathing, man,’ 

Then the stretcher-bearers come and take him to the 
dressing-station. The stretcher bumps heavily against 
the corners of the fire-bays. Scarce gone , . . and all 
is as it was before. Somebody throws a shovelful of 



DOUCHY AND MONCHY 


43 


soil over the red patch and every one goes about his 
business. One has got callous. Only a new recruit 
leans, whitefaced, against the revetting of the trench. 
He is trying to see the hang of it all. It had been so 
sudden, such a terrible surprise, such a brutal and un¬ 
speakable assault. It can’t be possible, can’t be real. 
Poor fellow, there’s something quite different in store 
for you.... 

Often, too, it is quite jolly. Many of us take quite a 
sporting interest in the job. With a malicious satis¬ 
faction we observe the hits of our shells on the enemy 
trenches. * There’s a hit, my boy ! * * God ! See it 
go up ! ’ 4 Poor Tommy ! ’ They delight in shooting off 
rifle-grenades or sending light mortar bombs over, very 
much to the disgust of frailer spirits. 1 Leave off that 
nonsense, man. We get stink enough without that/ 
But nevertheless these hotheads are for ever puzzling 
out the best possible ways of slinging over bombs with 
home-made catapults or of making the ground in 
front of the trench murderous with explosive machines. 
Perhaps they cut a narrow passage through the wire in 
front of their posts in order to entice an enemy patrol, 
by this bait of an easy way through, straight up to their 
rifles. Another time they creep out over the top and 
tie a bell on to the wire and to this a long string which 
can be pulled in order to excite the English posts. 
Even the war is a joke to them. 

Afternoon coffee time is sometimes positively cheer¬ 
ful. Often the N.C.O. is bidden to give one of the 
officers his company on these occasions. It is done 
with great punctiliousness. * May I permit myself ?* 
‘ Most obedient thanks.’ A delightful quality of the 



44 


DOUCHY AND MONCHY 


Prussian officer is this precision of politeness in all 
situations. It gives something firm and characteristic 
even to the youngest of them. 

On the tablecloth of hessian there is even the glimmer 
of two china cups. Afterwards the batman puts a 
bottle and two glasses on the rickety table. Conversa¬ 
tion proceeds more confidentially. Strange to say, here 
too it is the love of one’s neighbour that affords the 
welcome topic of conversation. A vigorous gossip of 
the trenches has been evolved, and this is the mainstay 
of these afternoon visits. It might almost be a little 
garrison. Superiors, comrades, and those under one's 
command are subjected to a rigorous criticism. A new 
and engrossing rumour has just run through the platoon 
commanders' dugouts of all six companies from the 
right flank to the left. The observation officers who 
traverse the regimental front with telescope and sketch- 
map are not guiltless of it. Indeed, the company sector 
is by no means a sealed compartment. Rather it is a 
busy thoroughfare. Staff officers appear in the quiet 
morning hours and diffuse activity, very much to the 
annoyance of the front-line swine, who has just got 
down to it after the last spell of trench duty, and at the 
horrid cry, ‘ Divisional general in the trench ! ’ hurls 
himself buttoned and buckled again up the dugout 
steps. Besides these there are the pioneer officer and the 
trench-construction officer and the drainage officer, all 
of whom behave as though the trenches existed only to 
display their special tasks. The artillery observation 
officer who wants to put down a trial barrage is greeted 
with particular coldness, for no sooner has he retreated 
again with his telescope and periscope than the 



DOUCHY AND MONCHY 


45 

English artillery is announced and of course the infantry 
meets the bill as usual. Then the officers in command 
of entrenching detachments roll up. They plant them¬ 
selves in the platoon commander’s dugout till nightfall 
and drink rum and smoke and play Polish lottery, and 
at last leave as clean a table as the brown rats. It is 
late when a little fellow flits like a ghost through the 
trench, creeps up behind the posts and shouts ‘ Gas 
attack ! 9 in their ears, and then quietly ticks off the 
seconds it takes them to get their masks on. It is the 
gas officer. Lastly, at midnight, there’s a knocking 
on the plank door of the dugout. ‘ Have you dossed 
down already ? Here . . . sign on quick for twenty 
knife-rests and six dugout frames.’ The carrying 
party has come. So it is that—at least in quiet times 
—there’s an everlasting coming and going, till at last 
the dwellers in the dugout are tempted to sigh, ‘ If 
only they’d shell a bit and then at least there *d be 
some peace/ 

‘ May I take my leave, sir ? Duty in half an hour.’ 

Outside, the heaped-up earth of parapet and parados 
gleams in the last rays of the sun and the trench lies 
already in deep shadow. Soon the first Verey light will 
go up, the night guards are mounted, and the new day 
of the front-line soldier has begun. 



TRENCH WARFARE DAY BY DAY 


T HUS it was that our days passed in a fatiguing 
monotony, broken only by the short spells of 
rest at Douchy. Yet there were many pleasant 
hours even in the line. I often sat at the table of my 
little dugout, whose roughly planked walls, hung with 
weapons, had a look of the Wild West, and enjoyed a 
pleasant feeling of being comfortably tucked away, as I 
drank a cup of tea, read and smoked while my batman 
was busy at the tiny stove and a smell of toast rose in the 
air. No one who has fought in the trenches has missed 
this mood. Outside, along the fire-bays went the stamp 
of heavy, regular steps ; a challenge rang out in mono¬ 
tone when some one passed along the trench. The 
dulled ear scarcely detects the never-ceasing rifle-fire, 
or the short whack of a bullet striking, or the Verey 
lights that sizzle near the opening of the air-shaft. It 
was then I took out my notebook from my map-case 
and wrote down in brief the events of the day. So, as 
time went on, a conscientious chronicle of C sector took 
shape as a part of my diary, a chronicle of one tiny 
snippet of the long front where we were at home and 
where at last we knew every overgrown bit of trench, 
every shelter whose roof had fallen in. Around us in 
heaped-up mounds of earth lay the bodies of fallen 
comrades. On every foot’s-breadth a drama had been 
enacted. Behind every traverse fate lay in ambush, 
day and night, to snatch a victim. And yet all of us 
felt a strong attachment to our sector and had almost 

46 



TRENCH WARFARE DAY BY DAY 47 

grown to be a part of it. We knew it when it ran as a 
black band across a landscape covered with snow, when 
at mid-day the flowery wilderness around pervaded it 
with drowsy scent, or when the eerie paleness of the 
full ghostly moon caught in its web those dark corners 
where the squeaking companies of rats carried on their 
secret existence. On the long summer evenings we sat 
on its fire-steps while the balmy air carried the busy 
hammerings or the songs of home across to the enemy ; 
we fell over timber and broken wire when Death 
drummed with his steel club on the trenches and a 
heavy vapour crept out from their shattered walls. 
Often the general wanted to give us a quieter part 
of the regimental front. Each time the company 
begged as one man to stay in sector C. I am setting 
down here a short selection from the notes that I wrote 
down on these nights at Monchy. 

7.10,19x5.—Standing at dawn near my section’s post 
on the fire-step opposite our dugout when a rifle bullet 
tore one of the men’s caps from front to back without 
hurting him. Just at this time two pioneers were 
wounded on our wire. One shot through both legs. 
The other shot through the ear. 

During the morning the left-flank post was shot 
through both cheek-bones. The blood spurted in 
thick streams from the wound. To finish the bad luck, 
Lieutenant Ewald came to our sector to-day to photo¬ 
graph sap N, which is only 50 metres from the trench. As 
he turned to get down off the fire-step a shot shattered 
the back of his head. He died instantly. Besides 
this, one of the men had a slight shoulder wound. 

19.10.—The sector of the middle platoon was shelled 



48 TRENCH WARFARE DAY BY DAY 

with 15-centimetre shells. One of the men was blown 
against the boarding of the trench. He suffered severe 
internal injury, and a splinter cut the artery of his 
arm. In the early morning mist, while repairing our 
wire in front of our right flank, we found a French 
corpse that must have been months old. In the night 
we had two casualties wire-carrying. Gutschmidt 
was shot through both hands and one thigh, Schafer 
through the knee. 

30.10.—Owing to heavy rain in the night the trench 
fell in in many places, and the soil mixing with the rain 
to a sticky soup turned the trench into an almost im¬ 
passable swamp. The only comfort was that the 
English were no better off, for they could be seen busily 
scooping the water out of their trench. As we were on 
higher ground, they had the benefit of the superfluous 
water we pumped out as well. The collapse of the 
trench walls brought to light a number of those who 
fell in the last autumn’s fighting. 

2.11. —I was standing next Landsturmsman Wieg- 
man in front of the Altenburg Redoubt when a long 
shot pierced his bayonet, which was hanging from his 
shoulders, and wounded him severely in the pelvis. 
The English bullets with their aluminium tips are 
pure dumdums. 

21.11. —I took an entrenching party from the Alten¬ 
burg Redoubt to C sector. One of them, Landsturms¬ 
man Diener, climbed on to a ledge in the side of the 
trench to shovel earth over the top. He was scarce 
up when a shot fired from the sap got him in the skull 
and laid him dead on the floor of the trench. He was 
married and had four children. His comrades lay in 



TRENCH WARFARE DAY BY DAY 49 

wait a long while behind the parapet to take vengeance. 
They sobbed with rage. It is remarkable how little 
they grasp the war as an objective thing. They seem 
to regard the Englishman who fired the fatal shot as a 
personal enemy. I can understand it. 

24.11. —A man of the machine-gun company got a 
bad head wound while in our sector. Half an hour 
later one of our company was hit in the cheek. 

29.11. —Our battalion went back for fourteen days to 
the little town of Q. that lay in the divisional area, and 
was destined later to get such a sanguinary name. We 
went for training and to enjoy the blessings of life 
behind the line. While there I got my commission 
as lieutenant and was posted to the 2nd Company, 
where I was to see many cheery times, and stiff ones 
too. 

We were invited to many a heavy drink by the town- 
majors of Q. and neighbouring places, and had a little 
glimpse into the almost boundless sway that these 
village potentates exercised over their subjects and the 
inhabitants. The King of Q., as he called himself, a 
captain, was greeted on his appearance at table every 
evening with uplifted right hands and a thundering 
shout, ‘ Long live the King! ’ He played the capricious 
monarch till dawn, and punished every breach of his 
etiquette and its very intricate formulations with drinks 
all round. We front-line fellows, in our innocence, 
came out of it very badly. 

Next day he was to be seen after lunch, in thin dis¬ 
guise, proceeding through his domains in a dogcart to 
pay his visits on neighbouring Kings and do copious 
honour to Bacchus. Thus he made worthy preparations 

D 



50 


TRENCH WARFARE DAY BY DAY 


for the evening bout. He called it * making a raid/ 
Once he got into a dispute with the King of J., and sent 
a mounted military policeman to declare war. After 
several engagements, in the course of which two detach¬ 
ments of officers' grooms pelted each other with lumps 
of earth from small trenches furnished with wire 
entanglements, the King of J. unwisely regaled himself 
with Bavarian beer in the Q. canteen and was surprised 
and taken prisoner while visiting a secluded spot. He 
had to ransom himself with a large barrel of beer. 
Thus ended the battle of these mighty ones. 

The inhabitants were under strict discipline. Tres¬ 
passes and transgressions were speedily visited by the 
town-majors with fines or imprisonment. Much as I 
am the disciple of the logical gospel of force, I was dis¬ 
gusted by the painful exaggerations of it I witnessed in 
those days, such as the compulsion upon all inhabitants, 
women included, to salute officers. Such regulations 
are pointless, degrading, and injurious. Such was our 
method, however, all through the war. Punctilious 
over trifles, undecided in the face of the severest 
injuries from within. 

On the 11.12 I went over the top to the front line 
to report to Lieutenant R. Wetje, commanding the 
2nd Company, which was in C sector. It gave me a 
shock, as I jumped down into the trench, to see how it 
had altered during our fortnight's absence. It had 
fallen in until it was nothing but a large trough filled 
with mud a yard deep, in which its occupants splashed 
sadly about in an amphibious existence. As I sank in 
to my hips my thoughts recurred with sorrow to the 
King of Q. and his round table. We poor front-line 



TRENCH WARFARE DAY BY DAY 51 

swine! nearly all the dugouts had fallen in and the 
deep dugouts were flooded. For the next weeks we 
had to work without respite merely to get firm ground 
beneath our feet. For the time being I lived with 
Lieutenants Wetje and Boje in a dugout whose roof, 
in spite of a ground-sheet suspended beneath it, dripped 
like a watering-can. Every half-hour the batmen had 
to bail out the water with buckets. 

One morning, when, thoroughly wet through, I went 
up out of the dugout into the trench, I could scarcely 
believe my eyes. The field of battle that hitherto had 
been marked by the desolation of death itself had taken 
on the appearance of a fair. The occupants of the 
trenches on both sides had been driven to take to the 
top, and now there was a lively traffic and exchange 
going on in schnaps, cigarettes, uniform buttons, etc., 
in front of the wire. The crowds of khaki-coloured 
figures that streamed from the hitherto so deserted 
English trenches had a most bewildering effect. 

Suddenly there was a shot that dropped one of our 
fellows dead in the mud. . . . Whereupon both sides 
disappeared like moles into their trenches. I went to 
the part of the trench opposite the English sap and 
shouted across that I wished to speak to an officer. 
Some of the English did in fact go back, and presently 
returned from their main trench with a young man who 
was distinguished from them, as I could see through my 
glasses, by a smarter cap. At first we conversed in 
English and then rather more fluently in French, while 
the men stood round listening. I put it to him that one 
of our men had been killed by a treacherous shot. He 
replied that this was the doing of the company on his 



TRENCH WARFARE DAY BY DAY 


flank and not of his men. * II y a des cochons aussi chez 
vous/ he remarked when some shots from the sector 
next to ours passed close to his head ; and thereupon 
I made ready to take cover forthwith. We said a good 
deal to each other in the course of the interview in a 
fashion that can only be described as sportsmanlike, 
and would gladly at the end have made some exchange 
of presents in memory of the occasion. 

It has always been my ideal in war to eliminate all 
feelings of hatred and to treat my enemy as an enemy 
only in battle and to honour him as a man according to 
his courage. It is exactly in this that I have found 
many kindred souls among British officers. It depends, 
of course, on not letting oneself be blinded by an 
excessive national feeling, as the case generally is 
between the French and the Germans. The con¬ 
sciousness of the importance of one’s own nation ought 
to reside as a matter of course and unobtrusively in 
everybody, just as an unconditional sense of honour 
does in the gentleman. Without this it is impossible 
to give others their due. 

In order to be on a clear footing again we made a 
solemn declaration of war within three minutes of 
breaking off our parley ; and after ‘ Good evening ’ on 
his side and ‘ Au revoir 9 on mine, I had a shot, in spite 
of the regrets of my men, at his loophole. It was re¬ 
turned at once with one that nearly knocked the rifle 
from my hands. 

This was the first opportunity I had of surveying the 
ground before the sap, for it was madness to show the 
peak of a cap at this dangerous spot. One thing I 
noticed was that there was the skeleton of a Frenchman 



TRENCH WARFARE DAY BY DAY 53 

just in front of our wire, whose white bones shone out 
from the rags of his blue uniform. 

Shortly after this conference our artillery fired a few 
shells on the enemy trenches, whereupon, before our 
eyes, four stretchers were carried across the open 
without, to my delight, a single shot being fired from 
our side. From the English cap-badges we were left 
in no doubt after that day that we had the ‘Hindustani ’ 
Leicestershires opposite us. 

The weather towards Christmas became more and 
more dreary. We had to set up pumps in the trenches 
in order to make a show of keeping even with the water. 

During this time of mud, too, our casualty rate rose 
considerably above the average. For example, I find 
in my diary under 12.12 : ‘ To-day seven of our men 
were buried at Douchy and two more since have been 
shot dead *; and under 23.12 : * Mud and dirt get the 
upper hand. This morning at three o’clock a regular 
landslide came thundering down the entrance of my 
dugout. I had to set three men to work, and it took 
them all their time to bail out the water that poured like 
a mountain torrent into the dugout. The trench is 
water-logged beyond hope. We are up to our waists 
in ooze. It is enough to make one despair. On the 
right flank a dead body is coming to light, the legs 
only so far.’ 

We spent Christmas Eve in the line. The men stood 
in the mud and sang Christmas carols that were 
drowned by the enemy machine-guns. On Christmas 
Day we lost a man in No. 3 platoon by a flanking shot 
through the head. Immediately after, the English 
attempted a friendly overture and put up a Christmas 



54 


TRENCH WARFARE DAY BY DAY 


tree on their parapet. But our fellows were so em¬ 
bittered that they fired and knocked it over. And this 
in turn was answered with rifle grenades. In this 
miserable fashion we celebrated Christmas Day. 

On the 28.12 I was commandant of the Altenburg 
Redoubt. It was on this day that one of my best 
men, Fusilier Hohn, had an arm torn off by a shell 
splinter. Another, Heidotting, was badly wounded in 
the thigh by one of the many stray bullets that buzzed 
round this low-lying strong post. My trusty August 
Kettler, too, was hit by a shrapnel bullet on the road to 
Monchy, where he was going to fetch my rations— 
the first of my many batmen. It got him in the wind¬ 
pipe and stretched him out. When he had started off 
with the dishes I called after him, ‘ August, don’t 
you stop one on the way ! * ‘No fear, sir.’ And now 
I was summoned and found him lying on the ground 
quite close to my dugout drawing every breath with a 
raucous noise through the wound at the base of his 
neck. I had him taken back, and he died in hospital 
some months later. On this occasion, as on many 
others, what I found particularly painful was that the 
wounded man could not say a word and only stared 
with helpless eyes like a tortured beast at those who 
tried to help him. It always made one feel more than 
usually powerless in face of another’s troubles. 

The way to Monchy from the Altenburg Redoubt cost, 
all told, a profusion of blood. It followed the further 
slope of a slight depression that lay 500 metres 
perhaps behind our front line. The enemy, who no 
doubt was aware from aeroplane photographs that the 
track was much used, made it his business to comb it 



TRENCH WARFARE DAY BY DAY

out with machine-gun fire at short intervals or to sling 
plenty of shrapnel at it. Although there was a trench 
running beside it, and though there were strict orders 
to use this trench, everybody made a practice of going 
along in the open with the usual indifference of the old 
soldier to the risk of a bullet. As a rule it was all right, 
but one or two victims were claimed daily, and this with 
time mounted up to a good number. Besides this, 
the builders of the Altenburg Redoubt had placed the 
latrine in the very lowest spot of the valley, where the 
stray bullets from every quarter of the compass ap¬ 
peared to forgather, so that one was often compelled to 
fly for the open clasping a newspaper in one hand and 
one’s clothing in the other. Nevertheless, this in¬ 
dispensable institution was left undisturbed in its 
perilous position, a speaking example of the general 
indifference to danger. 

January, too, was a month of unremitting labour. 
Each platoon, with shovels, buckets, and pumps, first 
removed the mud from the immediate neighbourhood 
of their dugout, and then, when they had solid 
ground under their feet, proceeded to establish com¬ 
munications with the sections on either side. In 
Adinfer wood, where our artillery was situated, forestry 
detachments were employed in stripping young trees 
of their branches and splitting them in long sections. 
The walls of the trench were sloped off and entirely 
revetted with this material. Numerous culverts and 
sump pits and gullies were constructed, till by degrees 
the conditions of life were bearable again. 

On the 28th January 1916 a man in my platoon got 
a body wound from a splinter of a bullet that was 



56 TRENCH WARFARE DAY BY DAY 

shattered to bits against his loophole plate. On the 
30th another got a bullet in the thigh. On the 1st Feb¬ 
ruary, the day of our relief, the communication trenches 
were being heavily shelled. A shrapnel shell fell just 
at the feet of Fusilier Junge, my one-time cleaner of 
the 6th Company. It did not explode, but flared 
up and he had to be carried away with severe 
bums. 

About the same time a N.C.O. of the 6th Company, 
whom I knew well and whose brother had been killed 
a few days before, was fatally injured by a 4 toffee-apple ’ 
which he had picked up. He had unscrewed the fuse, 
and observing that the powder was smouldering he put 
the end of his cigarette into the opening. Of course, 
the 4 toffee-apple ’ exploded and wounded him in over 
fifty places. In ways like this we were continually 
suffering losses through the carelessness that comes 
from constantly having to do with explosives. Lieu¬ 
tenant Pook was an uncomfortable neighbour for this 
reason. He inhabited a lonely dugout in a tangle of 
trenches behind the left flank, and there he had 
shepherded together a number of enormous duds. 
He occupied himself unscrewing their fuses and 
then examining them. I always gave this uncomfort¬ 
able dwelling a wide berth whenever I had to pass 
by it. 

On the night of the 3rd February we had arrived in 
Douchy once more after a fatiguing spell in the line. 
Next morning I was sitting in my billet on the Emmichs 
Platz in the mood appropriate to the first day of rest, 
comfortably drinking coffee, when suddenly a monster 
of a shell, the herald of a heavy bombardment,exploded 



TRENCH WARFARE DAY BY DAY 


57 


at my very door and blew the window into the room. 
With three bounds I was in the cellar, whither the other 
occupants of the house had also betaken themselves with 
astonishing speed, and there we presented a lament¬ 
able picture. As the cellar was half above ground 
and separated from the garden only by a thin wall, we 
all crowded into the short, cramped neck of a shaft. 
My sheep-dog crept whimpering between our tightly- 
packed bodies with an animal’s instinctive desire for 
the darkest comer. Far away in the distance one heard 
the heavy reports at regular intervals, followed within a 
few seconds by the whistling howl of the heavy lumps 
of metal hurtling through the air and ending in crash 
after crash as they exploded all round our little house. 
Each time an unpleasant rush of air came through the 
cellar window, clods of earth and splinters rattled on 
the tiled roof, and in the stalls the terrified horses 
snorted and reared up. The dog whimpered, and 
a fat bandsman, as each shell came whistling over, 
cried aloud as though he was going to have a tooth 
pulled out. 

At last the weather cleared and we could emerge 
again into the open air. The devastated village street 
was as lively as a disturbed ant-heap. My quarters had 
a sorry appearance. Close to the cellar wall the earth 
was tom up in several places, fruit trees were snapped 
off, and in the middle of the doorway lay a long and 
sinister dud. The roof was riddled with holes. A big 
splinter had carried off the chimney. In the company 
orderly-room next door a few sizable splinters had 
pierced the walls and a large wardrobe and tom 
nearly all the officers’ uniforms that were kept there. 



58 TRENCH WARFARE DAY BY DAY 

Their owners were very much incensed, but I myself 
was among those who escaped. 

On the 8th February, C sector was badly shelled. 
Already in the early hours our own artillery landed a 
dud into the dugout of my right-flank section. The 
inmates had an unpleasant surprise when it pushed in 
the door and overturned the stove. A witty fellow 
drew a caricature in which eight men were rushing for 
the shattered door over the smoking stove while the 
dud observed them from the corner with an evil wink. 
Besides this, at mid-day we had three dugouts smashed 
in. Fortunately, only one man was wounded slightly 
in the knee ; for every one, even the posts, had been 
withdrawn into the deep dugouts. On the next day 
Fusilier Hartmann of my platoon got a mortal wound in 
the side. It was from a shell from the flanking battery. 
On the 25th February we had a very severe loss through 
the death of a very fine fellow and a great favourite. 
Just before the relief I got word in my dugout that 
Karg, a volunteer, had been hit in the deep dugout 
near-by. I went along and found, as so often before, a 
sad group standing round a motionless figure. The 
hands on the bloodstained snow were clenched and the 
glazed eyes stared into the sky. One more victim of 
the flanking battery. Karg, when the first few came 
over, was in the trench and at once jumped into the 
shaft of the deep dugout. A large splinter from a shell 
that struck the wall of the trench just opposite flew into 
the dugout entrance and hit him in the back of the head 
when he thought himself in safety. He died an instant, 
unlooked-for death. 

The flanking battery was, indeed, very active during 



TRENCH WARFARE DAY BY DAY 


59 

those days. Almost hourly it fired a single unexpected 
salvo and the shell splinters fairly swept the trench. 
In the six days from the 3rd February to the 8th it cost 
three dead and three severely and three lightly wounded. 
Though it was at the utmost 1500 metres from us on a 
hillside on our left flank, it was beyond the power of our 
artillery to silence it. The only means we had of 
diminishing its effectiveness lay in increasing the 
number of our traverses and heightening them so 
that the range of a shell-burst was confined to short 
lengths of trench. 

With the beginning of March we had the worst of the 
mud behind us. The weather was dry and the trench 
freshly revetted ; and now and then we had an hour or 
two of leisure and comfort. I sat every evening in my 
dugout at my little writing-table and read, or talked 
when I had a visitor. We were four officers with the 
company commander, and we passed our days together 
on the best of terms. 

We met for coffee in the dugout of one or the other 
of us every day, or sat together in the evening over a 
bottle or two and smoked, played cards, and comported 
ourselves like soldiers of fortune. Those pleasant 
hours in the dugout outweigh the memory of many days 
of blood and dirt and exhaustion. They were, too, 
only possible during the long periods of, comparatively 
speaking, quiet trench warfare, during which we became 
completely at home with each other and fell into almost 
peace-time habits. Our chief pride lay in our building 
activities, to which the gentry further back contributed 
very little. We sank a shaft of thirty steps near the other 
deep dugout into the soft chalky ground, and connected 



60 TRENCH WARFARE DAY BY DAY 

the two by a gallery at right angles to the shaft. By this 
means we could go in comfort six metres underground 
from the one flank of our platoons to the other. My 
pet enterprise was a gallery sixty metres long running 
from my platoon headquarters to the company com¬ 
mander’s dugout, provided on the right hand and on the 
left with chambers for ammunition and living-rooms. 
These places were of the utmost value during the 
subsequent fighting. 

When, after morning coffee (one even got the paper 
pretty regularly), we met each other washed and 
shaved in the trench footrule in hand, we compared 
progress in our respective parts of it, while the talk 
turned on dugout frames, pattern dugouts, hours of 
work, and such matters. At night when I lay down on 
my plank bed I always had the pleasant consciousness 
of having in my sphere fulfilled the expectations those 
at home had of me. I had given all my energies to the 
defence of my two hundred metres of the front line, 
and cared for the well-being of my sixty men. 

It was only now when there was time for it that I was 
able to experience this feeling to the full. In the winter 
months we had not a thought in the trenches but of 
digging and * Will this damned business never end ? * 
It is not danger, however extreme it may be, that 
depresses the spirit of the men so much as over-fatigue 
and wretched conditions. People who have leisure 
can afford themselves every luxury, even that of heroic 
feelings. This is true for the people as a whole. Its 
moral worth can only reach its full height when the 
pressure of work is not crushing upon any section of it. 

On the ist of March, as I was standing behind a 



TRENCH WARFARE DAY BY DAY 


61 


ground-sheet with Landwehrsman Ikman, who was 
killed not long after, a shell burst straight in front of us. 
The splinters flew about us without a hit. When we 
took a closer look we found that numerous fragments of 
steel of a length and sharpness that turned the stomach 
had ripped the ground-sheet. The men called these 
things rattles or grape-shot, because there was nothing 
to be heard of them but a shower of splinters that 
suddenly whistled round you. 

On the 14th March there was a direct hit from a 
15-centimetre shell in the sector on our right. It 
killed three men and severely wounded three more. 
One of them disappeared without leaving a trace. 
Another was burnt black. On the 18th the sentry 
in front of my dugout was hit by a shell splinter that 
tore off one cheek and the top of one ear. 

On the 19th, Fusilier Schmidt II, on the left flank of 
my platoon, got a bad head wound. On the 23rd, 
Fusilier Lohmann was killed near my dugout by a shot 
in the head. On the same evening one of the posts 
reported that an enemy patrol was on our wire. I left 
the trench with a few men, but nothing came of it. 

On the 7th of April, on the right flank of the platoon, 
Fusilier Kramer was wounded in the head by the 
splinter of a bullet. We had a great many casualties of 
this kind owing to the ease with which the English 
bullets flew into fragments at the least impact. At 
mid-day the neighbourhood of my dugout was plastered 
with heavies for hours together. My skylight was 
smashed for the umpteenth time, and at every detona¬ 
tion there was a hail of hard lumps of soil through the 
opening. We drank our coffee, however, unmoved. 



62 TRENCH WARFARE DAY BY DAY 

Later we had a set duel with a harebrained English¬ 
man who showed his head over the parapet of a trench 
ioo metres away at the utmost, and got a succession of 
bull’s-eyes on our loophole. I and several others 
answered his fire, when a perfect shot got the edge of our 
embrasure and filled our eyes with dust and gave me 
a very slight skin wound in the neck from a splinter. 
Nevertheless, we did not give in, but kept bobbing up 
and taking a short aim and disappearing again. A 
moment later a bullet struck Fusilier Storch’s rifle and 
burst, covering his face with blood from at least ten 
wounds. The next shot tore a piece from the edge of 
our embrasure. Another smashed the glass we used 
for observation. We had the satisfaction, however, 
after several shots had struck the parapet in front of his 
face, of seeing him disappear for the last time. Just 
after, I got the plate behind which this mad fellow had 
kept appearing time after time with three shots of K. 
ammunition, and sent it flying. 

On the 9th of April two English fliers flew up and down 
just above our position. The entire trench strength 
rushed into the trench and opened a furious fire. I 
had just said to Lieutenant Sievers, who was standing 
beside me, 4 If only the flanking battery doesn’t look 
lively ! ’ when the fragments of steel flew about our 
ears, and we jumped for the nearest dugout stairs. I 
advised him to come further in, when, smack! a splinter 
as broad as your hand fell, still smoking, at his feet. 
Just afterwards we had a few shrapnel shells as well 
that burst over our heads. A man was hit by a pin’s- 
head splinter on the shoulder, and small as it was the 
wound was painful. I replied with a few rifle-grenades, 



TRENCH WARFARE DAY BY DAY 63 

for it was an unwritten law of the infantry to confine 
themselves to the rifle. When it came to explosives, 
the retaliation was always at the least in the ratio of 
two to one. Unfortunately, the enemy was so plenti¬ 
fully supplied with munitions that at first it took our 
breath away. 

After these excitements we drank a few bottles of 
red wine in Sievers’s dugout, and I became unawares 
so elated that, in spite of brilliant moonlight, I walked 
home over the top. Losing my direction, I soon found 
myself in an enormous mine-crater, and heard the 
English at work in their trenches close by. After I 
had made myself a nuisance by throwing them two 
bombs, I betook myself with all speed back to our 
trench, and on the way fell foul of one of our foot- 
angles consisting of four iron spikes. During this 
time a fairly lively activity prevailed in front of the 
wire, and sometimes it was not without a certain savage 
humour. One of our fellows on patrol was shot at 
because he stammered and could not get out the pass¬ 
word quick enough. Another time one of the men, 
returning at midnight after a festive evening in the 
kitchen at Monchy, climbed out over the entangle¬ 
ments and opened fire on his own trench. When his 
ammunition was exhausted he was hauled in and 
soundly thrashed. 



THE OVERTURE TO THE SOMME 
OFFENSIVE 


I N mid April 1916 I was detailed to attend an 
officer’s training course at Croisilles, a little town 
behind the divisional front. The course was 
under the personal charge of the general of the division, 
Major-General Sontag. Theoretical and practical 
instruction was given in a whole series of military 
matters. The lessons in tactics on horseback with 
Major Jarotzky were particularly attractive. We made 
a number of expeditions to see the great organization 
that had been conjured up practically out of nothing 
in the back areas ; and it gave us an idea, accustomed 
as we were to look down on all that went on behind 
the fighting line, of the immense amount of work that 
went on in rear of the fighting troops. We saw the 
slaughter-houses, the commissariat depot, and the 
equipment for the repair of guns at Boyelles, the saw¬ 
mills and pioneer park in Bourlon wood, the dairy and 
the pig farm and plant for turning carcases to account 
at Inchy, the aviation park and the bakery at Qu^ant. 
On Sundays we motored to the neighbouring towns of 
Cambrai, Douai, and Valenciennes, ‘in order to see 
women for once.’ 

I had not been at all pleased to leave the front line 
and my platoon, to which I had grown more and more 
attached ; but still I used the time to rid myself com¬ 
pletely of war and its clamour. I had books sent me, 
and I read and wrote and rode and went long walks 

64

and made a collection of beetles, and in order to fight 
my rooted tendency to solitude I was glad to spend 
my evenings in the mess, where there soon grew up 
that cheerful, careless spirit that is characteristic of a 
body of Prussian officers. 

It would not be right, in a book so full of bloodshed 
that I am afraid the reader may weary of it, to suppress 
a little adventure in which I played a somewhat comic 
part. When our battalion in the winter had been the 
guests of the King of Q., I had, as a newly commissioned 
officer, to inspect the guard for the first time. As I 
was leaving the place in search of a small guard posted 
in a railway station, I lost myself, and had to ask the 
way at a little cottage standing alone. The only occu¬ 
pant was a seventeen-year-old girl called Jeanne, whose 
father had died not long before. She now kept house 
there alone. After giving me the information I asked, 
she smiled and said : * Vous etes bien jeune. Je 
voudrais avoir votre avenir.’ I gave her the name of 
Jeanne d’Arc, because of the martial spirit that inspired 
these words, and when I was back in the trenches I 
often thought of the bare and lonely cottage. 

One evening, at Croisilles, I suddenly had the im¬ 
pulse to ride over there. I had a horse saddled, and 
the town was soon behind me. It was an evening of 
May, as though designed for a romantic excursion. 
The clover lay in dark red billows over the meadows, 
whose hedges were white with may and the chest¬ 
nuts were like giant candelabra standing lit up in the 
dusk before the villages. I rode through Bullecourt 
and Ecoust without ever dreaming that two years 
later I should be going over the top in an attack on 

H 



66 THE OVERTURE TO THE 

the ruins of these very villages that now lay so peace¬ 
fully with their ponds and the hills behind. 

At the little station where I had inspected the guard, 
civilians were still unloading gas-containers. I stayed 
watching them a while, and next the cottage gleamed 
out at me between its lilacs and red hawthorn, with 
its dark red tiles and the round lumps of moss. 
I knocked on the shutters, for they were already 
closed. 

‘ Qui est la ? ’ 

‘ Bon soir, Jeanne d’Arc ! ’ 

I was given as friendly a welcome as I could have 
hoped. When I had tied up my horse I went in, and 
was invited to supper: eggs, white bread, and butter, 
which was most appetizingly put on a cabbage-leaf. 
My small hostess meanwhile displayed that ease of 
manner that one finds so often in France among quite 
simple girls. 

So far there would have been no fault to find, but 
later, when I was leaving, a military policeman 
flashed a torch at me and asked for my credentials. 
My talk with the civilians, the care with which I had 
observed the unloading of the gas-drums, and the un¬ 
familiarity of my appearance in a district where there 
were few soldiers billeted, had all combined to awake 
a suspicion of espionage. Of course, I had forgotten 
my paybook, and so I was haled before the King 
of Q., who was as usual still in conclave at the 
round table. 

King and court alike behaved towards me with 
humour and discretion, and I was welcomed as one 
of the company. This time I saw the King in another

light. The hour was late, and he discoursed of prim¬ 
eval tropical forests in which he had been employed for 
years laying a railway. He spoke well and vividly. 
We saw coast towns, with low white buildings gleam¬ 
ing out over the sea, caravans vanishing within forests 
aswoon with heat, blue butterflies spreading their 
iridescent wings, and clusters of crimson orchids 
blooming in festoons from trees that hung over mighty 
torrent-beds. 

The strange figure of the King was indeed a sign 
that even the strictest army organization cannot so 
entirely mop up the personal element in life that 
nothing remains of man but his functions. Here was 
an oddity luxuriating from the grey soil of the war, 
and I was too little of the soldier pure and simple to 
be annoyed at it. 

Hence too came the charm of my little adventure, to 
which there were other chapters to be added. Its 
charm lay in the contrast between its tender rural 
colours and the brazen background. The little pleas¬ 
ures that life offered borrowed an unimagined enhance¬ 
ment from the unceasing thunder of the guns and 
from the destiny whose oppression never left one’s 
mind. The colours were more affecting. The wish 
to knit oneself with life in enjoyment was more 
urgent. For the thought crept into everybody’s mind : 
‘ Perhaps this is the last spring you will see.’ This 
gave an indescribable intensity to every expression of 
life, and after such an experience one can understand 
the peculiar wish of Stendhal, * La perfection de la 
civilisation serait de combiner tous les plaisirs delicats 
du igme si tele avec la presence plus fr£quente du

danger/ Or, as Schiller expresses it in a manlier way 
without the taint of decadence : 

1 Be the summons to-morrow, yet to-day let us taste 
The crest of each moment too precious to waste/ 

On the 16th of June we were dismissed to our units 
after a brief address by the general, from which we 
learned that the enemy were getting ready for a big 
offensive on the western front, and that the left flank 
of it would be just opposite our part of the line. 

It was clear to us after joining the regiment that 
something was in the air, for we were told by the others 
of the increasing activity of the enemy. The English 
had twice—without success, to be sure—attempted a 
raid in force against C sector. We had retaliated, after 
heavy preparation, by an attack of three officer patrols 
on the so-called trench triangle, and had taken a good 
number of prisoners. During my absence Lieutenant 
Wetje was wounded in the arm by a shrapnel bullet, but 
was again in command of the company soon after my 
return. My dugout had altered also. A direct hit had 
reduced it by half. The English, on the raid above 
mentioned, had smoked it out with bombs. The 
officer in command in my place succeeded in escaping 
by the skylight, but his batman was killed. The blood 
was still to be seen in large brown stains on the lining 
boards. 

On the 20th June I was detailed to discover by listen¬ 
ing in front of the enemy trench whether mining was 
going on, and at n o’clock I clambered through our 
pretty high wire entanglements with Fahnrich Wohl- 
gemut, Lance-corporal Schmidt, and Fusilier Parthen-

felder. We covered the first stretch stooping, and 
then crawled on close together through the long grass 
and weeds. Memories of school reading-books came 
back to me as I crept on my belly through dewy grass 
and thistle stems, painfully anxious to avoid cracking 
the least twig, for fifty metres in front the English 
trenches rose as a black streak in the half-light. The 
bullets of a distant machine-gun fell almost perpen¬ 
dicularly round us ; here and there a Verey light went 
up and threw its cold illumination on the desolate 
plots of ground. 

Once there were loud crackling sounds behind us. 
Two shadows passed along swiftly between the 
trenches. Just as we made ready to jump on them 
they vanished. Immediately after, the thunder of two 
bombs in the English trench told us it was two of 
our men who had crossed our path. We crawled 
slowly on. 

Suddenly the Fahnrich clutched my arm : * On the 
right, quite close—gently, gently.* Directly after, I 
heard sundry rustlings in the grass ten metres to our 
right. With one of those lightning intuitions that come 
to one on such occasions I saw the whole situation. We 
had been crawling the whole time along the English 
wire. They had heard us and now had come out of the 
trench to examine the ground in front of them. 

Such moments on the prowl by night are unforget¬ 
table. Eyes and ears are stretched to their utmost. 
The sound of the enemy’s feet coming nearer through 
the tall grass assumes a remarkable and portentous dis¬ 
tinctness that takes almost entire possession of one. 
The breath comes in gasps and it is all you can do to

suppress the noise of it. The safety-catch of your 
revolver goes back with a little metallic click—a sound 
that goes through the nerves like a knife. The teeth 
grate on the fuse-pin of the bomb. The fray will have 
to be short and murderous You are aquiver with two 
violent sensations—the tense excitement of the hunter 
and the terror of the hunted. You are a world in 
yourself, and the dark and horrible atmosphere that 
broods over the waste land has sucked you in utterly 
to itself. 

A succession of indistinct figures rose up close behind 
us. Whispering voices came to us. We turned our 
heads in their direction. I heard Parthenfelder, a 
Bavarian, bite on the blade of a dagger. 

They came still a few steps nearer, but then began to 
work on the wire, apparently without having observed 
us. Without taking our eyes off them we crawled 
slowly back. Death, after towering up between the 
two parties in eager expectation, took himself off in 
disgust. After a time we got on to our feet and were 
soon safely back in the trench. 

The happy issue of our excursion inspired us with 
the thought of taking a prisoner, and we resolved to see 
about it the next evening. In the afternoon, when I 
had just lain down to get a little rest in view of our 
plans for the night, I was scared out of my wits by a 
terrific crash close to the dugout. The Englishmen 
were sending ‘toffee-apples ’ over which, in spite of the 
moderate report they made when fired off, were of such 
weight that the splinters from them smashed the stout 
tree-trunk posts of the revetment clean through. I 
clambered cursing from my coucher and into the trench,

intending to jump down the nearest deep dugout 
with a shout of * Bomb left! ’ as soon as I saw one of 
these black fellows describe his circular course through 
the air. We were so generously provided with trench- 
mortar bombs of every calibre and description during 
the next weeks that it became second nature when going 
along the trench to keep one eye aloft and the other on 
the nearest deep dugout entrance. 

That night, then, I once more prowled about 
between the trenches with three companions. We 
crawled on all-fours right up to the English wire and 
there took cover behind scattered clumps of grass. 
After a while several English appeared dragging a roll 
of wire. They stopped just in front of us and began 
cutting at the roll of wire with wire-clippers and talking 
in whispers. We crept nearer together in order to hold 
a muttered consultation. ‘ A bomb in the middle of 
them and then grab him.’ 

* But there are four of them, man ! ’ 

* Don’t talk rot! ’ 

‘Mind,mind!’ My warning came too late; asllooked 
up, the English crept like lizards under their wire and 
disappeared in the trench. We now felt somewhat un¬ 
easy. Thethought that they would lose notime in bring¬ 
ing a machine-gun into action gave me a nasty taste in the 
mouth. The others, too, had the same anxiety. With 
much rattling of weapons we retreated on our bellies. 
There was a great stir in the English trench, hushed 
voices and a loud pattering of feet to and fro. Swish! 
—a Verey light! All round us it was light as day 
while we endeavoured to hide our heads in clumps 
of grass. Another Verey light. Painful moments. If 



72 THE OVERTURE TO THE 

only one could sink into the earth or be anywhere 
else than ten metres in front of the enemy’s trench. 
One more, and then ping . . . ping . . . the unmis¬ 
takable report of rifle-shots at short range. They Ve 
spotted us. 

Without more ado we shouted to each other our in¬ 
tention of making a dash for it, and jumping up we 
raced for our own lines in a hail of bullets. After a few 
steps I stumbled and fell into a small and shallow shell- 
hole, while the three others, thinking I was done for, 
careered past me. I flattened myself to the ground and 
let the bullets sweep over me through the long grass. 
The burning pieces of magnesium from the falling 
Verey lights, many of which burned out close to me, 
were not much pleasanter. Gradually the fire slack¬ 
ened, and after another quarter of an hour I crept from 
my refuge, slowly at first and then as fast as hands and 
knees would carry me. As the moon had set mean¬ 
while, I soon lost all sense of direction, and had not the 
least idea where either English or Germans were. Not 
a glimpse could I see of Monchy Mill on the horizon. 
Now and then a shot frqm one side or the other whistled 
by with a very ugly sound. At last I lay down in the 
grass and determined to wait for dawn. Suddenly I 
heard a whisper close by me. Once more I put myself 
in fighting trim, and then prudently uttered a few 
sounds that might proceed equally from an Englishman 
or a German, determined to reply to the first word of 
English with a bomb. I was glad to find they were my 
own fellows, who were just unbuckling their belts to 
carry in my corpse on them. We sat together for a bit 
in the shell-hole and rejoiced over our fortunate re- 



SOMME OFFENSIVE 


73 

union. Then we returned to our own trench, from 
which we had been absent three hours. 

I was out again on trench duty at five. In No. i 
platoon I found Sergeant-major H. in front of his dug- 
out. I was surprised to see him at this early hour, and 
he told me that he was lying in wait for an enormous 
rat whose gnawing and scratching prevented him 
sleeping. He took the opportunity of showing me his 
dugout, which was absurdly diminutive, and which he 
had christened the 4 bantam’s perch/ 

While we were standing together there was a dull 
report which certainly did not betoken anything out of 
the way. H., who on the day before had very nearly 
stopped a large mortar-bomb and was consequently 
very nervous, went like a flash for the nearest dugout 
steps and, taking the first fifteen sitting, put the re¬ 
mainder to good use in three somersaults. I stood 
above in the entrance and laughed till I cried over this 
painful interruption of a rat-hunt. The poor victim 
meanwhile was tenderly rubbing various parts of his 
body and attempting to put back a dislocated thumb. 
The unlucky fellow told me that he had been sitting at 
his supper when the mortar-bomb arrived, and not only 
had his food been entirely smothered in dust, but on 
that occasion as well he had fallen downstairs. 

After this enlivening interlude I repaired to my dug- 
out, but I was not destined to-day, either, to have the 
refreshment of sleep. From early morning we were 
bombarded by trench-mortars with ever-lessening 
intervals. Towards mid-day it got too lively for me 
altogether. With the help of a few men I got our 
Lanz mortar into action and started firing on the enemy 



74 


THE OVERTURE TO THE 


trenches. It was, I must say, but a poor return for the 
heavy stuff with which we were so generously favoured. 
We crouched on the sun-cracked ground in our little 
gun-pit, and sweating sent over bomb after bomb. 
The English were not at all put out, so I had recourse 
with Lieutenant Wetje to the telephone, and after 
mature consideration sent off the following S.O.S. : 
‘ Helen is spitting into our trenches. Nothing but 
great big bits. We want potatoes all sizes/ 

We had recourse to this rigmarole in case the enemy 
might be listening in. Very soon there came the com¬ 
forting reply from Lieutenant Deichmann that the fat 
sergeant-major with the stiff moustache and a few 
of his younger brothers were coming forward. Im¬ 
mediately after, the first of our two-hundredweight 
bombs hurtled into the enemy's trench with an in¬ 
credible detonation. It was followed by a few salvoes 
from the field artillery, and after that we had peace for 
the rest of the day. 

At noon next day, however, the ball was opened in 
an even livelier fashion. At the first shot I went by my 
underground gallery to the second line, and from there 
to the communication trench where we had made our 
mortar emplacement. We opened fire, and for every 
4 toffee-apple' that came over we returned a Lanz. 
After we had exchanged about forty bombs it appeared 
that the enemy had marked us down and was aiming 
for us. Soon they fell to right and left of us. But we 
kept on firing till one came straight for us. We pulled 
through our trigger-line once more at the last moment 
and then ran for it. I had just reached a muddy trench 
blocked with wire when the brute exploded close behind 



SOMME OFFENSIVE 


75 

me. The rush of air sent me flying over a bundle of 
barbed wire into a shell-hole full of green slime, with 
a shower of hard clods hurtling after me. I got up half- 
stunned. I was in evil plight. Breeches and boots 
were ripped with barbed wire. My face and hands and 
uniform were plastered with mud, and one knee was 
bleeding from a long scratch. Somewhat put out 
of action, I crept back along the trenches to get a 
little rest. 

Apart from this the enemy’s fire had done no great 
harm. The trench was blown in here and there, a 
Priester mortar was smashed, and the ‘ bantam’s perch ’ 
was disposed of by a direct hit. Its unfortunate 
owner had already bestowed himself in a deep dugout. 
Otherwise he would no doubt have seized the oppor¬ 
tunity for a third fall downstairs. 

The firing continued all afternoon without a break, 
and towards evening rose to the pitch of drum-fire 
with innumerable cylinder bombs. Our fellows called 
these cylinder-shaped missiles * clothes-baskets,’ and it 
often looked as though the sky was raining baskets. 
We sat in the deep dugout entrances in tense expecta¬ 
tion, ready to receive all comers with rifle and bomb. 
However, after half an hour the fire slackened off again. 
During the night there were two more outbursts. The 
men on guard remained unmoved on the fire-steps. 
As soon as the fire ceased we made a brilliant display of 
light rockets, and every man hurried out of the deep 
dugouts to assure the enemy by a furious burst of rifle- 
fire that the spirit of the Hanover Fusiliers was not to 
be broken. 

In spite of this crazy bombardment we lost only one 



76 THE OVERTURE TO THE 

man, Fusilier Diersman, whose skull was smashed by a 
mortar bomb that struck the parapet in front of him. 
Another man was wounded in the back. 

The day following this disturbing night there were 
many bursts of firing to warn us of an approaching 
attack. The trench was shot all to bits during these 
days, and, owing to the broken timber of the revetment, 
was almost impassable. A number of dugouts were 
smashed in besides. 

Brigade headquarters sent forward an intelligence 
report: * Intercepted English telephone message : The 
English give precise information of the gaps in our 
wire and are asking for steel helmets. Whether steel 
helmets is a code word for trench heavies is not yet 
known. Be prepared ! * 

We decided to stand-to during the succeeding night. 
It was made known that every one who did not answer 
with his name at the word ‘ Hallo * would instantly be 
shot. Every officer had a red light in his pistol so that 
the artillery could have prompt warning. 

The night was even crazier than its forerunners. In 
particular, a concentration of fire at 2.15 a.m. beat any¬ 
thing that preceded it. A perfect hail of heavies fell in 
a circle all round my dugout. We stood in fighting 
order on the steps of the deep dugouts. The light of a 
candle-end flickered on the moist and mildewed walls. 
A bluish vapour streamed in at the entrances. The earth 
flew from the edges of the trench. Wumm ! ‘ Damn 

the thing ! ’ * Match, somebody ! ’ ‘Be ready ! ’ 

One’s heart beat in one’s throat, trembling fingers 
loosened the pins of the bombs. * That’s the last one! * 
‘ Outside! * As we crowded out, one more with a delay-

action fuse went up and slung us backwards. Never¬ 
theless, while the last of the iron fowl came dropping in, 
every fire-step was already manned. We opened rapid 
fire, and the ground in front, wreathed in swathes of 
smoke, was brightly lit up with light-rockets. 

When the firing had ceased we had one more loss. 
Fusilier Nienhuser suddenly fell from the fire-step and 
rolled bumping down the dugout steps into the middle 
of a group of his fellows assembled at the bottom. 
When we examined him we found a small wound on the 
forehead and a puncture over the right nipple from 
which blood was flowing. It was impossible to say 
whether the wounds or the fall had killed him. 

At the close of this night of alarms we were relieved 
by the 6th Company. We moved off down the com¬ 
munication trenches to Monchy in that peculiar brand 
of ill-humour that is produced on exhausted nerves and 
sleepless eyes by a bright morning sunshine. From 
there we proceeded to the reserve line, lying along the 
edge of Adinfer wood. A magnificent panorama of the 
battle of the Somme in its opening stages was spread 
before us. The front-line sectors were veiled in clouds 
of white and black smoke, and one upon another the 
shell-bursts towered up into the sky. Above them the 
brief flash of exploding shrapnel could be seen by the 
hundred. 

When at last we were hoping for a little sleep that 
night, orders came to load heavy trench-mortar am¬ 
munition in Monchy, and we had to wait the whole night 
and to no purpose for a railway waggon that had got 
hungup somewhere, while the English made numerous 
attempts on our lives, fortunately without result, by 



THE OVERTURE TO THE 


78 

high-angle machine-gun fire and shrapnel exploding 
right over our heads. I was particularly annoyed by 
one artist with the machine-gun who fired at such an 
angle that the bullets, from the mere force of gravity, 
came straight down on us. It was no good taking 
cover from them behind a wall. 

During this night the enemy gave me an example of 
the closeness of his observation. In the second line, 
about 2000 metres from him, a heap of white chalk 
was thrown up from a deep dugout that was being 
excavated for an ammunition dump. The English, 
unfortunately, were right in concluding that this heap 
would be removed the following night, and sent over a 
salvo of shrapnel, by which three men were severely 
wounded. 

Next morning I was roused from sleep once more, 
with orders to take my platoon as a working party to 
C sector. My sections were distributed among the 
6th Company, and I then returned with a few men to 
Adinfer wood and set them to work felling timber. 
On the way back to the line again I went into my dug- 
out for half an hour’s rest. All to no purpose, for I 
was not to have a moment’s peace these days. I had 
scarcely pulled off my boots when I heard our own 
artillery start a peculiarly lively fire from the edge of 
the wood. At the same moment my batman, Paulicke, 
appeared at the top of the dugout steps and shouted 
down, ' Gas attack ! * 

I snatched up my gas-mask, pulled on my boots, 
buckled my belt, and, running outside, saw an immense 
gas-cloud hanging in heavy white swathes over Monchy, 
and rolling towards Point 124 in the low ground. 



SOMME OFFENSIVE 


79 

As most of my platoon were in the front line, and as 
an attack was very probable, there was only one thing 
to be done. I jumped over the entanglement in front 
of the reserve line and was soon in the middle of 
the gas-cloud. I put on the mask, but quickly tore it 
off again. I had run so fast that I could not get 
enough air through the intake. The eye-pieces, too, 
were misted over in a second, so that I could see 
nothing. As I felt pains in the chest I tried at least 
to get through the cloud of gas as quickly as I could. 
On the edge of Monchy I had to pass through a bar¬ 
rage. The shells, interspersed with puff after puff 
of shrapnel, burst in an unbroken chain across the 
desolate country, which no one at the best of times 
ever traversed. 

Artillery fire of that kind in the open country where 
there is freedom of movement has never, either actu¬ 
ally or morally, the same effect as among buildings or 
in the trenches. In a moment I had the belt of fire 
behind me. But then I found myself in Monchy. A 
literal storm of shrapnel was breaking over it. Showers 
of bullets, splinters, and fuses whistled through the 
air, swept through the branches of the orchard trees 
in the garden wildernesses, and crashed against what 
remained of the ruined walls. 

I found Sievers and Vogel, both officers of my 
company, sitting in a dugout in one of the gardens. 
They had made a blazing fire, and were bending over 
the flames to counteract the effects of the chlorine. 
I kept them company and did likewise until the bom¬ 
bardment slackened, and then went on to the front line 
by No. 6 communication trench. 



8 o THE OVERTURE TO THE 

As I walked along I saw numbers of small beasts 
lying dead on the bottom of the trench, killed by the 
chlorine, and I thought as I saw them, 4 Another 
barrage will come down any moment, and if you go 
fooling about like this you ’ll find yourself caught 
without cover like a mouse in a trap/ Nevertheless, 

I went on with the utmost unconcern. 

As it turned out, I was caught in a fresh and even 
wilder outburst just fifty metres from the company 
dugout. It seemed quite out of the question to pass 
even the short length of trench without being hit. By 
good luck I saw a little shelter that had been dug out 
in the side of the trench for despatch-riders. It was 
only the width of three dugout frames—not much, but 
always something. So there I crouched and let the 
storm go over me. 

It seemed to me that I had chosen the hottest corner. 
Light and heavy 4 toffee-apples / Stokes bombs, shrapnel, 

‘ rattles,* shells of every description, till at last I could 
no longer distinguish one from another as they came 
droning, moaning, and crashing all round me. I had 
to think of my good corporal in' the forest of Les 
Eparges and his cry of horror : 4 What do you think 
of these ones, eh ? * 

Now and then the ear was utterly dazed by a single, 
absolutely hellish crash accompanied by a sheet of 
flame. Then an unceasing and sharp swishing gave the 
impression again that hundreds of pound weights were 
flying after each other through the air with incredible 
velocity. Then came another dud, plunging with 
a short, heavy thump that shook the solid earth all 
round. Shrapnel exploded by the dozen, as prettily 



SOMME OFFENSIVE 81 

as crackers, scattering their little bullets in a heavy 
shower, with the empty cases whizzing after them. 
When a shell went up near-by, the soil rattled down in 
a torrent, and with it the jagged splinters as sharp as 
razors rent the air on all sides. 

It is easier, nevertheless, to describe all this than to 
go through it, for the brain links every separate sound 
of whirring metal with the idea of death, and so the 
nerves are exposed without protection and without 
a pause to a sense of the utmost menace. Thus I 
crouched in my little hole with my hand in front of 
my eyes, while all the possibilities of being hit passed 
through my imagination. I believe I have found a 
comparison that exactly conveys what I, in common 
with all the rest who went through the war, experienced 
in situations such as this. It is as if one were tied 
tight to a post and threatened by a fellow swinging a 
sledge-hammer. Now the hammer is swung back for 
the blow, now it whirls forward, till, just missing your 
skull, it sends the splinters flying from the post once 
more. That is exactly what it feels like to be exposed 
to heavy shelling without cover. Fortunately for me 
personally, I always have the confidence at the back 
of my head that things will soon be better. One has 
the same feeling, too, at games; and though it may 
have no justification, it has at least the merit of reliev¬ 
ing the nerves. And so this bombardment as well 
came to an end, and I was able to set out again, this 
time at top speed. 

Every one in the front line, according to the regula¬ 
tions laid down for a gas attack and so often rehearsed, 
was busily greasing his rifle, which the gas had en- 

F

THE OVERTURE TO THE 


tirely blackened. A Fahnrich sorrowfully showed me 
his new sword-knot, whose brilliance had been turned 
to a blackish green. 

As there was no movement of the enemy, I withdrew 
with my platoon. In Monchy I saw a number of gas 
casualties sitting in front of the first-aid post. They 
were pressing their hands to their sides and groaning 
and choking, while water ran from their eyes. Their 
condition was no laughing matter, for some of them 
died a few days later in frightful agony. We had had 
a gas attack of pure chlorine to go through. It has 
a corrosive and burning action on the lungs. I 
resolved from that day onwards never to go out with¬ 
out my mask, as I had done over and over again up to 
now, leaving, with incredible folly, my mask behind, 
and taking the case like a botanizing box with a piece 
of bread-and-butter inside. On the way back I went 
to buy something at the 2nd Battalion canteen, and 
there I found the wretched canteen-keeper in the midst 
of a heap of goods all smashed to smithereens. A shell 
had come through the roof and exploded among his 
stores and turned them into a remarkable medley of jam 
and tinned foods and green soap. He had promptly 
drawn up a statement of losses incurred, amounting to 
82 marks 58 pfennigs, with true Prussian exactitude. 

In the evening my platoon, that had hitherto been a 
detached party in the second line, was brought forward 
into the village on account of the uncertain state of 
the front. We were given the underground quarry as 
our quarters. We made ourselves comfortable in its 
numerous recesses, and heaped up an enormous fire. 
The shaft of the well served as chimney, as we could 



SOMME OFFENSIVE 


83 

tell from the rage of certain company cooks who were 
nearly suffocated while drawing water. We had had 
a double ration of grog, and we sat on lumps of chalk 
round the fire and sang and drank and smoked. 

At midnight the salient in front of Monchy became 
an inferno. Dozens of alarm-bells were ringing, 
hundreds of rifles were firing, and green and white 
rockets went up without ceasing. Immediately on this 
our barrage came down, and a trail of fiery sparks 
could be seen each time a heavy trench-mortar fulmi¬ 
nated. Through it all, wherever a human soul inspired 
the tumult, there rang out the long-drawn cry, ‘ Gas 
attack ! Gas attack ! * 

A whitish wall of gas, fitfully illumined by the light 
of the rockets, was moving over Monchy. As a strong 
smell of chlorine was noticeable in our cavern, we lit 
fires of straw at the entrances. The acrid smoke 
nearly drove us out of our refuge, and we were forced 
to clear the air by waving coats and ground-sheets. 

Next morning we had the opportunity of marvelling 
at the effects of a gas attack. Nearly every green thing 
was withered, snails and moles lay dead on every side, 
and any despatch-riders’ horses that were in Monchy 
had water running from their mouths and eyes. The 
ammunition and the shell splinters that lay everywhere 
were covered with a beautiful green patina. Even 
Douchy, lying far to the rear, shared the effects of the 
gas-cloud. The civilians, who did not like it at all, 
assembled in front of Lieutenant-Colonel von Oppen’s 
quarters and asked for gas-masks. They were put on 
lorries and taken to places further in the rear. 

We spent the next night in the quarry again. In the 



THE OVERTURE TO THE 


84 

evening I got the message that we were to have coffee at 
4.15, as an English deserter had declared that there was 
to be an attack at 5. And, in fact, I had scarcely been 
awakened by the return of the party sent for the coffee 
when the now familiar cry, 4 Gas attack! ’ rang out. 
There was a sickly smell of phosgene in the air, and 
the drum-fire on the Monchy salient was terrific. It 
soon, however, died down. 

A lively morning followed. Lieutenant Brecht 
emerged on the village street from communication 
trench No. 6 with a blood-stained bandage round one 
hand, accompanied by one of his men with fixed bayonet 
and an English prisoner. He was received in west 
headquarters, and told the following story : 

The English had released gas- and smoke-screens at 5, 
and at the same time smothered the trench with trench- 
mortar fire. The men as usual had left their cover 
before the firing stopped, and we had thirty killed. 
Then two strong raiding parties appeared out of the 
smoke. One of the two had forced their way into the 
trench and taken off a wounded N.C.O. The other was 
held up on the wire. The only one of them who got 
through was taken prisoner by Lieutenant Brecht, who 
had led a planter’s life in America before the war, and 
who seized him by the throat and shouted, 4 Come here, 
you son of a bitch ! ’ This sole representative was now 
entertained with a glass of wine. With half-frightened, 
half-astonished eyes he looked up the village street that, 
deserted a moment ago, was now crowded with ration- 
parties, stretcher-bearers, despatch-carriers, and all 
whom curiosity could collect. The prisoner was a tall 
young fellow with yellow hair and the face of a child. 



SOMME OFFENSIVE 8 S 

‘ A pity/ thought I, as I looked at him, 4 to have to shoot 
such a fellow as that/ 

Soon a long train of stretchers arrived at the dressing- 
station. From the South sector, too, there were many 
casualties, for in company sector E also a strong raiding 
party had got into the trench. About fifty stretchers 
on which lay groaning men with blood-soaked bandages 
were set down in front of some huts of corrugated iron. 
Inside, the doctor, with his sleeves rolled up, was busy 
at his job. 

A young fellow, whose blue lips on a face as white as 
a sheet looked very bad, was muttering, ‘ It *s all up. 
... I shan’t ever again . . . I Ve got . . . to . . . 
die/ A fat Medical Corps sergeant looked at him with 
pity, and to comfort him kept murmuring, ' Now now, 
my boy, now now ! ’ 

Although the English had prepared for this minor 
attack, of which the chief object was to divert some of 
our reserves from the front of the Somme offensive, 
by numerous trench-mortar bombardments and gas 
attacks, they succeeded in taking only one wounded 
man prisoner, and they left a number of dead in front 
of our wire. Certainly, our losses also were consider¬ 
able. The regiment that morning had forty killed, 
including three officers. 

At noon of the next day we went back at last to our 
beloved Douchy for a few days, and the same evening 
we celebrated the happy outcome of the little affair 
with a few well-earned bottles of wine. 

On the first of July we had the sad duty of burying 
some of the dead in our burial-ground. Thirty-nine 
plain wooden coffins were lowered into the grave. The 



86 


THE OVERTURE TO THE 


address by the Pastor Phillippi was so affecting that the 
men cried like children. The text was, ‘ You have 
fought a good fight/ and he began with the words, 
* Gibraltar—that is your motto; and truly you have 
stood like a rock in a raging sea ! * 

The great value of ceremonial observances was made 
clear to me on this affecting occasion. We have often, 
one time and another, left ten times the number of dead 
on the field and yet not been so deeply touched by the 
loss as we were that day beside the open graves. 

I learned during these days to value at their true 
worth the men with whom I had still three more years 
of fighting to go through. 

You will not find a man in the whole army who can 
be relied upon so implicitly to do his duty simply and 
without fuss as the man of Lower Saxony. When 
there was the need to prove, 1 Here stands a man, and 
if need be here he falls . . .,’ not one of them ever 
wavered. It showed great self-mastery to leave the 
security of the deep dugout and face the storm of fire 
during those days in the trenches when the trench- 
mortar bombs were exploding by the hundred and when 
the flanking battery swept us with shrapnel and when 
bits and splinters were hurtling all ways. In the open 
field there may be some pleasure in showing your 
courage, but it is another thing to clench your teeth and 
to go to your post alone in the night and under fire. 
It is just this quality of courage that I have always 
marvelled at in those quiet, fair-haired Saxons. 

On the evening of the 3rd of July we went back to the 
line. It was comparatively quiet, though there were 
still signs of there being something in the wind. The

machine never ceased to throb and hammer. We often 
intercepted suspicious telephone conversations about 
gas-containers and mines addressed to an English R.E. 
officer in the front line. From early morning to dusk 
enemy aeroplanes kept our trenches under fire. The 
average daily bombardments were much heavier than 
usual. In spite of this we were relieved on the 12th 
July without having had any unpleasant experiences, 
and went into reserve at Monchy. 

On the evening of the 13th July our dugouts in the 
garden were under fire from a 24-centimetre naval 
gun. The heavy shells came whistling over and 
exploded with a really frightful noise. During the 
night we were awakened by lively firing and a gas 
attack. We sat in the dugout round the stove with our 
masks on. Vogel, who could not find his, ran to and 
fro in great distress, while some of his comrades, who 
bore him no love, took a malicious joy in declaring that 
the smell of gas was getting stronger every moment. 
At last I gave him my spare re-fill, and he hugged the 
smoking stove for an hour like an image of misery and 
coughed and held his nose with a piteous air and 
pulled away at the mouthpiece. 

On the same day I had two casualties in my platoon 
—Hasselmann with a rifle wound in the arm, and 
Maschmeier with a shrapnel bullet in the neck. 

No attack followed that night. Nevertheless, it was 
a bad business and cost the regiment twenty-five dead 
and many wounded. On the 15th and 17th we had 
two more gas attacks to go through. On the 17th we 
were relieved, and were twice shelled in Douchy—once 
while Major von Jarotzky was addressing the assembled

THE OVERTURE TO THE 


officers in an orchard. It was irresistibly comic, in 
spite of the danger, to see how the company flew apart, 
nearly falling on their noses in their extreme haste to 
get through the fences and vanish like lightning wher¬ 
ever cover was to be found. In the garden of my billet 
a little girl of eight years old was killed by a shell while 
rummaging for rubbish in a pit. 

On the 20th July we were back in the line. On the 
28th I arranged with Wohlgemut and the volunteers, 
Bartels and Birkner, to go on patrol. We had no other 
object in view than to make a little tour on the other 
side of the wire and to see what No-man’s-land might 
bring forth : for trench life had begun by degrees to 
be monotonous again. In the afternoon Lieutenant 
Brauns of the 6th Company, who was relieving me, paid 
me a visit in the dugout and brought one or two bottles 
of good wine with him. It was half-past eleven when 
we broke up the meeting, and I then went into the trench, 
where I found my three comrades standing together in 
the dark corner of a traverse. After picking out a few 
dry bombs I climbed over the wire in the best of spirits, 
while Brauns shouted after me : ‘ Give ’em hell ! 9 

It was not long before we had stalked the enemy wire. 
Close in front of it in high grass we discovered a stout 
and well-insulated wire. I thought the discovery 
might have some importance, and I told Wohlgemut to 
cut a piece off and take it back with him. While he was 
employed with a cigar-cutter in default of a better 
instrument, there was a clink of wire immediately in 
front of us, and a party of English appeared and began 
to work on the wire without observing us in the grass. 

With the annoying experience of previous patrols in 



SOMME OFFENSIVE 89 

my mind I breathed an almost inaudible ‘ Wohl- 
gemut, bomb in the middle of them ! * 

‘ Better leave them to get to work, sir ! * 

‘ An order’s an order, Fahnrich ! * 

The spirit of the Prussian drill-yard did not fail to 
breathe its spell even in this wilderness. I heard the 
dry rasp of the fuse-pin as he pulled it out, and I had 
the doomed feelings of a man who has let himself in for 
a very uncertain adventure. I saw Wohlgemut lob the 
bomb along the ground in order to show himself as 
little as possible. It stopped in some weeds almost at 
the feet of the English, who clearly had noticed nothing. 
A few moments of intense expectation went by. Then 
a bang and a flash lit up the reeling figures. We sprang 
like tigers into the white cloud of smoke with the 
shout, * You are prisoners ! * 

In less than a second all was confusion. I held my 
pistol against a face that shone out like a white mask 
in the darkness. A shadow squeezed backwards into 
the wire and cried out. Close to me on my left 
Wohlgemut fired his revolver, while the volunteer, 
Bartels, in the excitement of the moment blindly slung 
a bomb into the midst of us. 

At the first shot the magazine of my revolver dropped 
out, and I stood shouting at an Englishman who 
squeezed himself in horror closer and closer against the 
barbed wire. Again and again I pressed the trigger, but 
not a shot rang out. It was a nightmare. There was 
now a tumult in the trench. Shouts were followed by 
the rattle of a Lewis gun. We jumped back. I took 
cover in a shell-hole and turned my revolver on a 
shadow behind me. This time it was lucky I could not

fire, for it was Birkner behind me, though I thought he 
had long since got back. 

After this we made a dash for our own trench, but in 
front of our wire the bullets came so thick that I had to 
jump into a crater full of water and laced over with wire. 
Swinging on a barbed hammock over the face of the 
waters, I listened with mixed feelings to the dense hail 
of bullets sweeping past, while bits of wire and splinters 
plunged into the lip of the crater. After half an hour, 
when the firing had died down, I worked my way over 
our entanglements and jumped into the trench, where 
a joyful welcome was ready for me. Wohlgemut 
and Bartels were there already, and after another half- 
hour Birkner turned up too. There was general re¬ 
joicing over our lucky escape. The only regret was 
that a prisoner had again slipped through our fingers. 
When I lay down on the bed-boards in the dugout I 
realized that my nerves had been touched. My teeth 
were chattering, and, exhausted though I was, I could 
not sleep. Next morning I could scarcely walk. I 
had torn one knee on the wire, and the other had a 
splinter in it from the bomb Bartels had chucked at me. 

These brief and sporting interludes were, all the 
same, a good tonic for the nerves and a relief from 
the monotony of trench life. 

On the nth of August a black horse was galloping to 
and fro behind the English lines in front of Berles-au- 
Bois. A Landwehrsman brought it down with three 
shots. The English officer from whom it had run 
away must have made a very sorry face at this sight. 
During the night the case of a rifle bullet hit Fusilier 
S. in the eye.

In the village, too, the casualties were more and more 
frequent. The walls were levelled by artillery fire, and 
there was less and less cover against the random bursts 
of machine-gun fire. We began to connect up the 
village with trenches and to build up the walls at the 
most dangerous spots. 

The 12th of August was the long-desired day when 
I got my second leave. However, I had scarcely got 
home and made myself comfortable when a telegram 
came after me : * Return immediately. Further orders 
from the town-major, Cambrai.’ 

Three hours later I was sitting in the train. On the 
way to the station I met three girls in light summer 
dresses, with tennis-rackets in their hands, laughing as 
they went. It was a brilliant farewell life gave me, and 
one that I often thought of when I was back in the line. 

On the 21st I was once more in the well-known 
neighbourhood. The roads, owing to the departure 
of the 1 nth Division and the arrival of the new one, 
were thronged with troops. The 1st Battalion lay in 
Ecoust-St.-Mein, which we stormed two years later. 
I spent the night in the attic of an empty house with 
eight other officers. 

In the evening we sat up a long while drinking coffee 
that two Frenchwomen made for us in a neighbouring 
house. It was the strongest drink we could procure. 
We knew that we were on the verge this time of a battle 
such as the world had never seen. Soon our excited 
talk rose to a pitch that would have rejoiced the hearts 
of any freebooters, or of Frederick’s Grenadiers. A 
few days later there were very few of that party still 
alive. 



GUILLEMONT 


O N the 23rd August we were transported in 
I lorries to Le Mesnil. Our spirits were ex¬ 
cellent, though we knew we were going to be 
put in where the battle of the Somme was at its worst. 
Chaff and laughter went from lorry to lorry. We 
marched from Le Mesnil at dusk to Sailly-Saillisel, and 
here the battalion dumped packs in a large meadow 
and paraded in battle order. 

Artillery fire of a hitherto unimagined intensity rolled 
and thundered on our front. Thousands of twitching 
flashes turned the western horizon into a sea of flowers. 
All the while the wounded came trailing back with 
white dejected faces, huddled into the ditches by the 
gun and ammunition columns that rattled past. 

A man in a steel helmet reported to me as guide to 
conduct my platoon to the renowned Combles, where 
for the time we were to be in reserve. Sitting with 
him at the side of the road, I asked him, naturally 
enough, what it was like in the line. In reply I heard a 
monotonous tale of crouching all day in shell-holes with 
no one on either flank and no trenches communi¬ 
cating with the rear, of unceasing attacks, of dead bodies 
littering the ground, of maddening thirst, of wounded 
and dying, and of a lot besides. The face half-framed 
by the steel rim of the helmet was unmoved ; the voice 
accompanied by the sound of battle droned on, and the 
impression they made on me was one of unearthly 

solemnity. One could see that the man had been 
92

through horror to the limit of despair and there had 
learnt to despise it. Nothing was left but supreme 
and superhuman indifference. 

‘ Where you fall,there you lie. No one can help you. 
No one knows whether he will come back alive. They 
attack every day, but they can’t get through. Every¬ 
body knows it is life and death.’ 

One can fight with such fellows. We marched on 
along a broad paved road that showed up in the moon¬ 
light as a white band on the dark fields. In front of us 
the artillery fire rose to a higher and higher pitch. 
Lasciate ogni speranza ! 

Soon we had the first shells on one side of the road 
and the other. Talk died down and at last ceased. 
Every one listened—with that peculiar intentness that 
concentrates all thought and sensation in the ear—for 
the long-drawn howl of the approaching shell. Our 
nerves had a particularly severe test passing Fregicourt, 
a little hamlet near Combles cemetery, under con¬ 
tinuous fire. 

As far as we could see in the darkness, Combles was 
utterly shot to bits. The damage seemed to be recent, 
judging from the amount of timber among the ruins 
and the contents of the houses slung over the road. 
We climbed over numerous heaps of debris—rather 
hurriedly owing to a few shrapnel shells—and reached 
our quarters. They were in a large shot-riddled house. 
Here I established myself with three sections. The 
other two occupied the cellar of a ruin opposite. 

At 4 a.m. we were aroused from our rest on the frag¬ 
ments of bed we had collected, in order to receive steel 
helmets. It was also the occasion of discovering a sack 



94 


GUILLEMONT 


of coffee-beans in a corner of the cellar ; whereupon 
there followed a great brewing of coffee. 

After breakfast I went out to have a look round. 
Heavy artillery had turned a peaceful little billeting 
town into a scene of desolation in the course of a day or 
two. Whole houses had been flattened by single direct 
hits or blown up so that the interiors of the rooms hung 
over the chaos like the scenes on a stage. A sickly scent 
of dead bodies rdse from many of the ruins, for many 
civilians had been caught in the bombardment and 
buried beneath the wreckage of their homes. A little 
girl lay dead in a pool of blood on the threshold of 
one of the doorways. 

The square in front of the ruins of the church had 
been particularly hard hit. Here was the entrance to 
the catacombs, a very ancient underground passage 
with recesses here and there in which were crowded the 
staffs of all the units engaged. It was said that the 
civilians had opened up the entrance with pickaxes 
when the bombardment began. It had been walled up 
and kept secret from the Germans during the whole of 
their occupation. The streets were reduced to narrow 
paths winding circuitously round and over heaps of 
timber and masonry. Quantities of fruit and veget¬ 
ables were going to waste in the churned-up gardens. 

A plentiful supply of * iron rations * provided us with 
a dinner that we cooked in the kitchen, and concluded, 
needless to say, with strong coffee. I then settled 
myself in an armchair upstairs. From letters scattered 
about I saw that the house belonged to a brewer, 
Lesage. Cupboards and chests of drawers were thrown 
open ; there was an overturned washstand, a sewing- 



GUILLEMONT 


95 

machine, and a perambulator. The pictures and the 
looking-glasses on the walls were all broken. Drawers 
had been pulled out and emptied, and a yard deep all 
over the floor were underclothes, corsets, books, papers, 
bedroom tables, broken glass, bottles, notebooks, chair 
legs, coats, cloaks, lamps, curtains, window-frames, 
doors torn from their hinges, lace, photographs, oil- 
paintings, albums, broken boxes, hats, flower-pots, and 
tom wall-paper, all tangled up together in wild con¬ 
fusion. 

The view through the broken windows showed the 
square utterly deserted, and ploughed up by the shells, 
which had strewn it with the branches of the limes. 
The artillery fire that raged round the place without 
ceasing deepened the gloom of this appalling picture. 
Now and then the gigantic crash of a 38-centimetre 
shell dominated the tumult; whereupon a hail of 
splinters swept through Combles, clattering through 
the branches of the trees, or striking on the walls of the 
few houses that were still left standing, and bringing 
down the slates from the roofs. 

In the course of the afternoon the firing increased to 
such a degree that single explosions were no longer 
audible. There was nothing but one terrific tornado of 
noise. From 7 onwards the square and the houses 
round were shelled at intervals of half a minute with 
15-centimetre shells. There were many duds among 
them, which all the same made the houses rock. We 
sat all this while in our cellar, round a table, on arm¬ 
chairs covered in silk, with our heads propped on our 
hands, and counted the seconds between the explosions. 
Our jests became less frequent, till at last the fool- 



GUILLEMONT 


96 

hardiest of us fell silent, and at 8 o’clock two direct hits 
brought down the next house. 

From 9 to 10 the shelling was frantic. The earth 
rocked and the sky boiled like a gigantic cauldron. 

Hundreds of heavy batteries were concentrated on 
and round Combles. Innumerable shells came howl¬ 
ing and hurtling over us. Thick smoke, ominously lit 
up by Verey lights, veiled everything. Head and ears 
ached violently, and we could only make ourselves 
understood by shouting a word at a time. The power 
of logical thought and the force of gravity seemed alike 
to be suspended. One had the sense of something as 
unescapable and as unconditionally fated as a catas¬ 
trophe of nature. A N.C.O. of No. 3 platoon went mad. 

At 10 this carnival of hell gradually calmed down and 
passed into a steady drum-fire. It was still certainly 
impossible to distinguish one shell from another. 

At 11 orders came to parade in the square. There 
we joined the other two platoons preparatory to march¬ 
ing into the line. There was a fourth platoon under 
Lieutenant Sievers detailed to carry rations forward. 
They surrounded us while we were hastily got together 
on this risky spot, and loaded us with things to eat, of 
which in those days there were still plentiful supplies. 
Sievers pressed a pan full of butter on me, and shaking 
my hand at parting wished me luck. 

Then we moved off in single file. Every man had 
the strictest orders to follow closely on the man in front. 
We had scarcely got out of the place before the guide 
found he had missed the way. We were compelled to 
turn back under heavy shrapnel fire. Next we were 
following, mostly at the double, a white band laid down 



GUILLEMONT 


97 

over the open ground to give the direction. It 
was shot into small bits. Often we had to come to 
a halt at the worst moment, when our guide lost 
his way. To lie down was forbidden, in case we 
lost touch. 

In spite of this, Nos. i and 3 platoons suddenly 
vanished. On again ! We got to a sunken road, much 
shelled, where the sections stowed themselves. * Lie 
down ’ was the order. A nauseous and oppressive 
scent warned us that this road had claimed many a 
victim. After a run that threatened death at every 
step we reached a second sunken road in which battle 
headquarters were concealed. Then we went the 
wrong way and had to turn back, nerve-racked and 
crowding on each other. Five metres, at the utmost, 
from Vogel and myself a medium-heavy shell struck 
the rear bank of the road with a dull crash and shot a 
volley of great clods on us, while its deadly fragments 
flew in a shower over our backs. At last the guide 
found the way again. ^ He had come upon a surprising 
landmark—a group of dead bodies. 

On and on ! Some of the men collapsed as they ran, 
for we were compelled to force the last ounce from their 
exhausted bodies. Wounded men called to us on left 
and right from the shell-holes and were disregarded. 
On and on, with our eyes fixed on the man in front, 
along a knee-deep trench formed of linked-up shell- 
holes of enormous size, where the dead were almost 
touching. Our feet found little purchase against their 
soft and yielding bodies. Even the wounded who fell 
by the way shared the same fate and were trodden 
beneath the boots of those who still hurried on.

And always this sickly smell. Even my orderly, 
little Schmidt, my companion in many a dangerous 
patrol, began to reel. I snatched the rifle from his 
hand, though even at such a moment his politeness 
made him resist me. 

At last we reached the front line. It was held by 
men cowering close in the shell-holes, and their dead 
voices trembled with joy when they heard that we were 
the relief. A Bavarian sergeant-major briefly handed 
over the sector and the Verey-light pistol. 

My platoon front formed the right wing of the posi¬ 
tion held by the regiment. It consisted of a shallow 
sunken road which had been pounded by shells. It 
was a few hundred metres left of Guillemont and a 
rather shorter distance right of Bois-de-Trones. We 
were parted from the troops on our right, the 76th 
Regiment of Infantry, by a space about 500 metres 
wide. This space was shelled so violently that no 
troops could maintain themselves there. 

The Bavarian sergeant-major had vanished of a 
sudden and I stood alone, the Verey-light pistol in my 
hand, in the midst of an uncanny sea of shell-holes 
over which lay a white mist whose swathes gave it 
an even more oppressive and mysterious appearance. 
A persistent, unpleasant smell came from behind. I 
was left in no doubt that it came from a gigantic corpse 
far gone in decay. 

As I had no idea how far off the enemy were, I warned 
my men to be ready for the worst. We all remained 
on guard. I spent the night with my batman and 
two orderlies in a hole perhaps one yard square and 
one yard deep. 



GUILLEMONT 99 

When day dawned we were astonished to see, by 
degrees, what a sight surrounded us. 

The sunken road now appeared as nothing but a 
series of enormous shell-holes filled with pieces of 
uniform, weapons, and dead bodies. The ground all 
round, as far as the eye could see, was ploughed by 
shells. You could search in vain for one wretched 
blade of grass. This churned-up battlefield was 
ghastly. Among the living lay the dead. As we 
dug ourselves in we found them in layers stacked 
one upon the top of another. One company after 
another had been shoved into the drum-fire and steadily 
annihilated. The corpses were covered with the masses 
of soil turned up by the shells, and the next company 
advanced in the place of the fallen. 

The sunken road and the ground behind was full of 
German dead ; the ground in front of English. Arms, 
legs, and heads stuck out stark above the lips of the 
craters. In front of our miserable defences there were 
tom-off limbs and corpses over many of which cloaks 
and ground-sheets had been thrown to hide the fixed 
stare of their distorted features. In spite of the heat no 
one thought for a moment of covering them with soil. 

The village of Guillemont was distinguished from 
the landscape around it only because the shell-holes 
there were of a whiter colour by reason of the houses 
which had been ground to powder. Guillemont rail¬ 
way station lay in front of us. It was smashed to bits 
like a child’s plaything. Delville wood, reduced to 
matchwood, was further behind. 

Day had scarcely dawned when an English flying-man 
descended on us in a steep spin and circled round 



IOO 


GUILLEMONT 


incessantly like a bird of prey, while we made for our 
holes and cowered there. Nevertheless, the observer’s 
sharp eyes must have spied us out, for a siren sounded 
its deep, long-drawn notes above us at short intervals. 
After a little while it appeared that a battery had re¬ 
ceived the signal. One heavy shell after another came 
at us on a flat trajectory with incredible fury. We 
crouched in our refuges and could do nothing. Now 
and then we lit a cigar and threw it away again. Every 
moment we expected a rush of earth to bury us. The 
sleeve of Schmidt’s coat was torn by a big splinter. 

At the third shot the occupant of the next hole to 
mine was buried by a terrific explosion. We dug him 
out instantly, but the weight of earth had killed him. 
His face had fallen in and looked like a death’s-head. 
It was the volunteer Simon. Tribulation had made 
him wise. Whenever in the course of the day, when 
airmen were about, any one stirred from his cover, 
Simon was heard scolding and his warning fist appeared 
from behind the ground-sheet that curtained his earth. 

At three in the afternoon the men came in from the 
left flank and said they could stick it no longer as their 
shelters were shot to bits. It cost me all my callousness 
to get them back to their posts. 

Just before ten at night the left flank of the regimental 
front was heavily shelled, and after twenty minutes we 
came in for it too. In a brief space we were completely 
covered in dust and smoke, and yet most of the hits were 
just in front or just behind. While this hurricane was 
raging I went along my platoon front. The men were 
standing, rifle in hand, as though carved in stone, their 
eyes fixed on the ground in front of them. Now and 



GUILLEMONT 


IOI 

then by the light of a rocket I saw the gleam of helmet 
after helmet, bayonet after bayonet, and I was filled 
with pride at commanding this handful of men that 
might very likely be pounded into the earth but could 
not be conquered. It is in such moments that the 
human spirit triumphs over the mightiest demonstra¬ 
tions of material force. The fragile body, steeled by 
the will, stands up to the most terrific punishment. 

Sergeant-major H., the unfortunate rat-catcher of 
Monchy, who was with the platoon on our left, intended 
to fire a white Verey light. By mistake he fired a red one, 
and this signal was taken up on all sides. At once our 
barrage came down to a tune which delighted us. One 
shell after another went howling over our heads and 
crashed in sparks and splinters over the ground in 
front of us. A mixture of dust, suffocating gases, and 
vaporous exhalations of corpses flung high in the air was 
blown back on us from the shell-holes. After this orgy 
of destruction, the fire returned to its customary level 
and stayed there all the night and the next day. One 
man in a moment of agitation had released the whole 
mighty machinery of war. 

H. remained what he was, an unlucky fellow. That 
same night he shot a Verey light into the leg of his 
boot while loading the pistol, and had to be carried back 
severely burnt. Next day it rained hard, and we were 
not/sorry. With the laying of the dust the parched 
feeling was relieved and the great clusters of blue¬ 
bottles which the sun had brought out were driven 
away. I sat nearly all day in front of my earth on the 
ground, smoking, and eating, too, with appetite, in spite 
of my surroundings. 



102 


GUILLEMONT 


The next morning, Fusilier Knicke of my platoon got 
a bullet from somewhere through the chest. It hit 
the spine too and paralysed his legs. When I went to 
see him he was lying in one of the shelter-holes quite 
resigned. In the evening when he was being carried 
back he had a leg broken on one of the many occasions 
when his bearers had to take cover from the shell-fire. 
He died at the dressing-station. 

At mid-day a man of my platoon got me to have a shot 
at a single Englishman in Guillemont railway station. 
When I looked I saw hundreds of English hurrying 
forward along a shallow communication trench. They 
were not particularly upset by the rifle-fire we could 
bring to bear on them. This sight showed the unequal 
terms on which we fought, for if we had ventured on 
anything like it our men would have been shot to 
pieces in a few minutes. While on our side not a 
captive balloon was to be seen, on the English side 
there were thirty at once over one spot, observing every 
movement with argus eyes and at once directing a hail 
of iron upon it. 

In the evening a big shell-splinter came hurtling for 
my stomach, but fortunately it was pretty well spent and 
fell to the ground after striking the buckle of my belt. 

Two members of an English ration-party who had 
lost their way appeared at dusk on No. i platoon front. 
Both were shot down at point-blank range. One of 
them fell half into the sunken road, while his legs 
remained on the top of the ditch. None of the men 
would take prisoners, for how could we get them 
through the barrage ? It was bad enough on our own 
without prisoners to see to. 



GUILLEMONT

Towards one in the morning I was roused from a 
confused sleep by Schmidt. I jumped up nervously 
and seized my rifle. It was our relief. We handed over 
what there was to hand over, and departed with all 
speed from this comer of hell. 

We had scarcely reached the shallow communication 
trench when the first group of shrapnel burst among us. 
The man in front of me reeled from a wound in the 
wrist from which the blood spurted. He wanted to 
fall out and lie down. I caught him by the arm and got 
him to his feet in spite of his dazed condition, and did 
not let him go till I handed him over in the dressing- 
station near battle headquarters. 

It was hot work in both of the sunken roads, and we 
got quite out of breath. The tightest comer of all was 
when we found ourselves in a hollow where shrapnel and 
light shells were coming over all the time ... Brrruch 1 
Brrrruch ! the rain of iron crashed round us, scattering 
a shower of sparks in the darkness. Whoee I Another 
volley ! We stopped, breathless, for I knew a fraction 
of a second in advance, from the sharpening intensity 
of sound, that the descending curve of the shell would 
end just where I stood. Immediately after there was 
a heavy crash at my very feet and the soft earth was 
flung high. This one of all others was a dud. 

A better opportunity could not be wished for making 
the influence of an officer tell. Everywhere relieved 
and reliefs were hurrying through the shells and the 
darkness, some of them utterly lost and dazed with ex¬ 
citement and exhaustion. Everywhere voices rang out, 
in command, or in monotonous supplication from the 
shell-holes where the wounded were left to their fate. 



104 


GUILLEMONT 


As we rushed by, I gave information to those who had 
lost their way, pulled men out of shell-holes, threatened 
to shoot any who wanted to fall out, kept shouting my 
name to keep my men together, and at last, as though 
by a miracle, I got my platoon back to Combles. 

From Combles we still had to march beyond Sailly 
and the Government farm to the forest of Hennois, 
where we were to bivouac; and now our exhausted con¬ 
dition made itself felt in earnest. We shuffled bitterly 
along the road with hanging heads. Motor cars and 
ammunition columns crowded us to the ditch. In a 
kind of nervous distemper I was convinced that the 
transport rattling by pushed us to one side so roughly 
only out of spite, and more than once I surprised myself 
with my finger on the trigger of my revolver. 

When our march was done we still had tents to pitch 
before we could throw ourselves down on the hard 
ground. During our time under canvas in this forest 
bivouac there were heavy downfalls of rain. The straw 
in the tents began to rot, and several of the men went 
sick. We five company officers were little put out by 
the dampness. Every evening we sat on our kit-bags 
under canvas, behind a battery of bottles. 

We went back to Combles after three days, where I 
occupied, with my platoon, four smallish cellars. The 
first morning it was comparatively quiet, so I took a 
little walk through the devastated gardens and plundered 
an espalier of some delicious peaches. On my wander¬ 
ings I got into a house surrounded by tall hedges, where 
a lover of beautiful old things must have lived. On 
the walls of the rooms there was a collection of painted 
plates, such as they love in northern France, holy- 



GUILLEMONT 


105 


water basins, copperplate engravings, and Nativities 
carved in wood. There were stores of old china, and 
lovely old leather bindings were scattered about the 
floor, a fine old Don Quixote among them. It was a 
pity to leave all these treasures to destruction. 

When I got back I found that the men had marauded 
the garden on their own account, and had now made 
a stew of bully and vegetables, in which there were 
potatoes, beans, carrots, artichokes, and many kinds 
of green vegetables. While we were eating, a shell hit 
the house, and three fell close by. But we paid little 
attention, for the surfeit of such sensations had blunted 
us. The house must have seen some casualties already, 
for a newly-carved cross stood on a heap of debris in 
the middle room, with a list of names carved in the 
wood. At noon on the next day I went to the house 
of the collector of china, and got a volume of the illus¬ 
trated Petit Journal. It is to be found in nearly every 
French household, and it abounds in villainous bad 
taste. I then established myself in a room that still 
held together, lit a small fire of broken furniture, and 
began to read. I often had to shake my head, for I had 
stumbled on the numbers printed while the Fashoda 
affair was on. At about seven I turned the last page and 
went into a little room at the top of the cellar steps, 
where the men were cooking at a little fireplace. 

I had scarcely joined them when there was a loud 
report in front of the door of the house, and at the 
same moment I felt a violent blow on my left calf. 
Shouting out that I was hit, I jumped down the cellar 
steps with my pipe still in my mouth. 

A light was lit in a moment and the matter looked 



GUILLEMONT 


106 

into. There was a ragged hole in my putties, from 
which blood ran on to the ground. On the other side 
there was the round swelling of a shrapnel bullet under 
the skin. The men bound me up and took me under 
fire to the catacombs, where our surgeon-major- 
general took me in hand. Lieutenant Wetje, who 
happened to be passing by, held my head while the 
bullet was cut out with knife and scissors. The surgeon 
congratulated me, for the bullet had passed between the 
shin and the fibula without any injury to the bone. 
‘ Habent sua fata libelli et balli/ remarked the old 
corps student with a grunt, as he handed me over to 
an orderly to be dressed. 

To my great joy many of my men came to say good¬ 
bye to me while I lay on a stretcher in a recess of the 
catacombs waiting for dusk. My honoured colonel, 
von Oppen, too, paid me a visit. 

When evening came I was carried to the outskirts 
of the town and put on a Red Cross waggon. The 
driver, without paying any heed to the cries of the 
occupants, went at full speed over the paved road, for 
it was being shelled, and neither shell-holes nor other 
obstructions could stop him. Finally we were taken 
on by motor to the village of Fins, and laid in the 
church, which was already crowded with wounded. 
A nurse told me that over 30,000 wounded had passed 
through Fins in the last few days. In the face of such 
figures I could not think much of the wound in my 
leg. From there I got to St. Quentin, whose windows 
shook in the incessant thunder of battle, and thence 
again in a hospital train to Gera, where I received the 
best possible attention in the garrison hospital. 



GUILLEMONT 


107 

I heard the subsequent fate of my company from 
friends in the other battalions who were wounded 
after I was. It was put back into the line on the 
day after I got my wound, and suffered severe losses 
marching up and also during ten hours’ drum-fire. 
It was then attacked from all sides owing to the 
large gaps in the line. Little Schmidt, Fahnrich 
Wohlgemut, Lieutenants Vogel and Sievers—in fact, 
nearly the whole company—had died fighting to the 
last. A few survivors only, Lieutenant Wetje among 
them, were taken prisoners. Not one man got back 
to Combles to tell the tale of this heroic fight that was 
fought to the finish with such bitterness. Even the 
English army command made honourable mention 
of the handful of men who held out to the last near 
Guillemont. 

I was no doubt glad of the chance shot that withdrew 
me as if by a miracle from certain death on the very 
eve of the engagement. At the same time, strange 
as it may sound, I would willingly have shared the 
fate of my comrades and stood with them shoulder to 
shoulder while the iron dice of war rolled over us. 
Instead of this, I kept the unquenchable fame of these 
men as my reminder, in the worst moments of the 
sanguinary conflicts that were yet in store, that I 
must show myself always worthy to have been their 
comrade. . . . 

It was the days at Guillemont that first made me 
aware of the overwhelming effects of the war of material. 
We had to adapt ourselves to an entirely new phase of 
war. The communications between the troops and 
the staff, between the artillery and the liaison officers, 



GUILLEMONT 


108 

were utterly crippled by the terrific fire. Despatch- 
carriers failed to get through the hail of metal, and 
telephone wires were no sooner laid than they were 
shot into pieces. Even light-signalling was put out of 
action by the clouds of smoke and dust that hung over 
the field of battle. There was a zone of a kilometre 
behind the front line where explosives held absolute 
sway. 

Even the regimental staff only knew exactly where 
we had been and how the line ran when we came back 
after three days and told them. Under such circum¬ 
stances accuracy of artillery fire was out of the question. 
We were also entirely in the dark about the English 
line, though often, without our knowing it, it was only 
a few metres from us. Sometimes a Tommy, feeling 
his way from one shell-hole to another like an ant along 
a track in the sand, landed in one that we occupied, and 
vice versa , for our front line consisted merely of iso¬ 
lated and unconnected bits that were easily mistaken. 

Once seen, the landscape is an unforgettable one. 
In this neighbourhood of villages, meadows, woods, 
and fields there was literally not a bush or a tiniest 
blade of grass to be seen. Every hand’s-breadth of 
ground had been churned up again and again; trees 
had been uprooted, smashed, and ground to touch- 
wood, the houses blown to bits and turned to dust; 
hills had been levelled and the arable land made a 
desert. 

And yet the strangest thing of all was not the horror 
of the landscape in itself, but the fact that these 
scenes, such as the world had never known before, were 
fashioned by men who intended them to be a decisive 



GUILLEMONT 


109 


end to the war. Thus all the frightfulness that the mind 
of man could devise was brought into the field; and 
there, where lately there had been the idyllic picture 
of rural peace, there was as faithful a picture of 
the soul of scientific war. In earlier wars, certainly, 
towns and villages had been burned, but what was that 
compared with this sea of craters dug out by machines ? 
For even in this fantastic desert there was the same¬ 
ness of the machine-made article. A shell-hole 
strewn with bully-tins, broken weapons, fragments of 
uniform, and dud shells, with one or two dead bodies 
on its edge . . . this was the never-changing scene 
that surrounded each one of all these hundreds of 
thousands of men. And it seemed that man, on this 
landscape he had himself created, became different, 
more mysterious and hardy and callous than in any 
previous battle. The spirit and the tempo of the 
fighting altered, and after the battle of the Somme the 
war had its own peculiar impress that distinguished it 
from all other wars. After this battle the German 
soldier wore the steel helmet, and in his features there 
were chiselled the lines of an energy stretched to the 
utmost pitch, lines that future generations will per¬ 
haps find as fascinating and imposing as those of many 
heads of classical or Renaissance times. 

For I cannot too often repeat, a battle was no longer 
an episode that spent itself in blood and fire ; it was a 
condition of things that dug itself in remorselessly week 
after week and even month after month. What was a 
man’s life in this wilderness whose vapour was laden 
with the stench of thousands upon thousands of decay¬ 
ing bodies ? Death lay in ambush for each one in 



no

every shell-hole, merciless, and making one merciless in 
turn. Chivalry here took a final farewell. It had to 
yield to the heightened intensity of war, just as all fine 
and personal feeling has to yield when machinery gets 
the upper hand. The Europe of to-day appeared here 
for the first time on the field of battle. . . . 

The terrible losses, out of all proportion to the 
breadth of front attacked, were principally due to the 
old Prussian obstinacy with which the tactics of the 
line were pursued to their logical conclusion. 

One battalion after another was crowded up into a 
front line already over-manned, and in a few hours 
pounded to bits. 

It was a long while before the folly of contesting 
worthless strips of ground was recognized. It was 
finally given up and the principle of a mobile defence 
adopted. The last development of this was the elastic 
distribution of the defence in zones. 

Thus it was that there were never again such bitterly- 
contested engagements as those that for weeks together 
were fought out round shell-shot woods or undecipher¬ 
able ruins. The names of the tiniest Picardy hamlets 
are memorials of heroic battles to which the history 
of the world can find no parallel. There it was that 
the dust first drank the blood of our trained and 
disciplined youth. Those fine qualities which had 
raised the German race to greatness leapt up once more 
in dazzling flame and then slowly went out in a sea of 
mud and blood. 



AT ST. PIERRE VAAST 


A FTER fourteen days in hospital and as long on 
ZJk leave I went back to the regiment, which was 
X. A. now in the line near Deux Nceuds, quite close 
to the well-known Grande Tranche. After my arrival 
it remained two days there, and the same time in the 
old mountain town of Hattonchatel. Then we en¬ 
trained at Mars-la-Tour for the Somme region once 


more. 

We detrained at Bohain again and went into quarters 
in the village of Brancourt, near by. This was a 
neighbourhood we often touched upon in later days. 
It was agricultural, and yet there was a loom in nearly 
every house. The inhabitants did not appeal to me. 
They were dirty and of a very low moral development. 
I was billeted on a cottage where lived a man and his 
wife and their daughter. I must own that in return for 
my money they made me most excellent dishes of eggs. 
The daughter told me over the first cup of coffee that 
she was going 4 to drink a good coffee with Poincari 
after his return/ by which she meant, give him a piece 
of her mind. I have never heard any one so fluent in 
abuse as this filia hospitalis , particularly on the topic of 
a neighbour whom she accused of having lived in a 
certain street of St. Quentin. * Ah cette p’lure, cette 
pomme de terre pourrie, jetie sur un fumier. C’est la 
crime de la crime / she spluttered while she raged round 
the room stretching out her hands like claws in the vain 

search for an object on which to vent her wrath. 

in 



112 AT ST. PIERRE VAAST 

In the morning, when this rose of Brancourt was 
busied making butter or some other domestic matter, 
she looked unbelievably uninviting. Yet in the after¬ 
noon, when it came to parading the village street with 
pride or visiting her friends, the ugly grub had turned 
into the splendid butterfly. I always observed with 
some mistrust a large box of rice-powder that never 
left the table, for it seemed to me to be a complete 
substitute for soap and water. 

One day the father begged me to forward an indict¬ 
ment to the town-major complaining of a neighbour 
who, not content with taking him by the throat and 
giving him a good beating, had shouted ‘ Demande 
pardon ! * while threatening him with death. 

Little observations of this kind gave me the comfort¬ 
ing assurance that national pride, even in France, is not 
a quality of the masses. Two years later, when we 
returned to our native land after honourable and exact¬ 
ing warfare, the knowledge of this helped me to get 
over the remarkable reception that some of our own 
people gave us. 4 II y a des cochons partout! * as the 
English officer very justly remarked to me in front of 
the trenches at Monchy. 

The 2nd Company was now under command of 
Lieutenant Boje. We spent our days here in the happy 
atmosphere of good fellowship. I must own that we 
often drank heavily until, indeed, we treated the whole 
world as no more than a laughable phantom that circled 
round our table. There were usually also uproarious 
sounds from the room occupied by our batmen. Those 
who have never known the brief spells that separate one 
murderous battle from another may hold up their

hands at us if they please. In any case we were glad to 
indulge ourselves and our men with every hour of 
debauch that life would yield while we were still within 
its circle. 

I shall not be taken for a dipsomaniac, though I 
mention drink so often. I have never flouted the time- 
honoured and social rites of the bottle. At the same 
time, both before the war and since I have often gone 
for months without drinking at all. But at the front 
one came out of the line covered with mud and in a 
bad temper, to have the few days on rest taken up in 
training . . . and then the night came in the mess, and 
the present was blotted out and only memory and hope 
were lit up. All the devastation of every kind that 
surrounded one was seen in the light of humour and in 
a state of bliss, however fleeting it might be, and was 
finally lost altogether in that light-hearted independ¬ 
ence of time that attends upon every toper. One 
broke through time, menacing and oppressive as it 
was, and rejoiced for an hour or two in a boundless 
world. The war left one with two memories, as I am 
sure every outspoken soldier of it will agree, that were 
always recurring: one, when one was faced with the 
worst moments it had to offer; the other, when the 
bottle went round as madly and merrily as ever it 
did in times of peace. It was only because these 
black and red threads were interlaced in fairly equal 
proportions that the experiences of the war were not 
intolerable. 

For the coming spell in the line I was appointed as 
scouting officer, and with a scout troop and two N.C.Os. 
was under the orders of the division. 

H

IX 4 

On the 8th November the battalion moved in pouring 
rain to Gonnelieu. There the scout troop was de¬ 
tached to Li&remont and put under the command of 
the divisional intelligence officer, Captain Bdckelmann. 
The captain, with us four scout officers, two observation 
officers, and his adjutant, was quartered in the priest’s 
house. There we lived very happily together in com¬ 
fortably furnished rooms. 

Our predecessors took us over the divisional front. 
We had to go up the line every second night. Our task 
was to ascertain exactly where the front line ran and to 
see that communications were maintained, so that if the 
need arose we should be able to take the troops into the 
line and carry out orders in an emergency. My sphere 
of action was a sector left of St. Pierre Vaast wood and 
immediately in front of the so-called ‘ Nameless * wood. 
The first night, after nearly drowning myself in crossing 
a marsh flooded by the Tortille, I got into a thick cloud 
of phosgene shell-gas, and scurried back with weeping 
eyes to Vaux wood. On the way I fell into one shell- 
hole after another, as I could see nothing through the 
misted eyepieces of the mask. 

On the 13th November, hoping for better luck, I set 
out again on my second tour of the line. My orders 
were to ascertain that touch was maintained between 
the shell-holes that constituted the front line. I 
struggled to my goal along a chain of posts concealed in 
holes in the ground. 

The shell-hole line deserved its name. A plateau in 
front of the village of Rancourt was pockmarked with 
innumerable miniature craters which here and there 
were occupied by two or three men. The monotony 



AT ST. PIERRE VAAST 


I1 S 

of the scene, where nothing was heard but the whistle 
and crash of shells, filled the mind with the dread of its 
utter desolation. After some time I lost touch with the 
line of shell-holes and went back in case I walked into 
the French. Soon after I came upon an officer I knew 
in the 164th Regiment, who warned me not to stay any 
longer now that dawn was breaking. So I hurried on 
through ‘ Nameless ’ wood, stumbling into deep shell- 
holes and over uprooted trees and through the almost 
impassable tangle of branches that covered the ground. 

When I left the edge of the wood it was daylight. 
Before me lay an expanse of shell-holes without a sign of 
life. I stopped short, for, in modem battle, stretches 
of ground where not a man is to be seen are always 
suspicious. 

Suddenly a shot from an unseen sniper got me in both 
legs. I flung myself into the nearest shell-hole and 
bound the wounds with my handkerchief, for, needless 
to say, I had forgotten my field-dressing. A bullet had 
passed through my right calf and grazed my left. 

I crept back into the wood with the utmost caution, 
and from there limped over the shell-shot ground to the 
dressing-station. Shortly before this I had an example 
of the little incidents on which the chances of war turn. 
I was making for the cross-roads about a hundred 
metres ahead of me, when an officer in command of a 
working party whom I had known in the 9th Company 
called out to me. We had scarcely been talking for a 
minute when a shell struck the cross-roads where but 
for this chance encounter I should probably have been 
at that moment. 

After dark I was carried on a stretcher to Nurlu, 



ii6 AT ST. PIERRE VAAST 

Captain Bockelmann was most kindly waiting for me 
with a car. We were proceeding along the chaussee in 
the light of the enemy searchlights when the driver 
suddenly applied the brakes. A dark obstruction 
barred the way. It was an infantry section with its 
N.C.O., which had just fallen a victim to a direct hit. 
It seemed as though death had united them in a 
peaceful sleep. 

I had to be taken into the cellar of the priest’s house, 
as Lieremont was just receiving its evening benediction. 
The same evening I was moved to the Villeret field 
hospital, and thence to the war hospital at Valenciennes. 

The hospital was installed in the gymnasium near the 
station, and accommodated four hundred severe cases. 
A funeral procession with muffled drums left the main 
entrance day after day. The whole misery of the war 
was concentrated in the spacious operating-theatre. 
The surgeons carried on their sanguinary trade at a row 
of operating-tables. Here a limb was amputated, there 
a skull chiselled away, or a grown-in bandage cut 
out. Moans and cries of pain sounded through the 
room in the flood of remorseless light, while nurses in 
white hastened busily from one table to another with 
instruments and dressings. 

The soldier who after such a sight goes back under 
fire with ardour unquenched has indeed withstood a 
test of nerve ; for every fresh and terrible impression 
claws itself into the brain, and is added to the prostrat¬ 
ing complex of imaginings that make the moment 
between the rush and the burst of a shell ever more 
frightful. 

Next to my bed a sergeant-major who had lost a leg 



AT ST. PIERRE VAAST 


117 

lay dying. In his last moments he woke from delirium 
and got the nurse to read him his favourite chapter of the 
Bible. Then in a voice scarcely audible he asked all 
his ward companions to forgive him for having so often 
awaked them from sleep by his delirious ravings, and 
then just before he died a few minutes later he tried to 
cheer us all up with an imitation of our orderly’s comic 
dialect. 

I was glad when after fourteen days I was able to 
leave this abode of piled-up agonies, with my wound 
half-healed. I had read with pride, meanwhile, of the 
magnificent and successful attack of the Fusiliers on 
St. Pierre Vaast wood. 

The 11 ith Division were still holding the same front. 
There were several explosions as my train trundled into 
Ep6hy. The ruins of goods trucks lumped up together 
showed that it was no joking matter. 

‘ What is going on here, I say ? 9 asked a captain 
sitting opposite me. He had the fresh and rosy air of 
having been exported straight from home. Without 
wasting time by a reply I tore open the door and took 
cover behind the railway embankment. Fortunately 
they were the last ones, and only a few horses were 
wounded. 

As I could not walk very well, I was given the post of 
observation officer. My field of observation was over 
the falling ground between Nurlu and Moislaines. I 
had a periscopic telescope built into a shelter, and with 
this I kept a look-out in the front line that I already 
knew well. My job was to ring up the division in case 
of heavy fire, coloured lights, or any other unusual 
events. All day long I crouched freezing on a chair 



AT ST. PIERRE VAAST 


118 

behind the glasses in the November mist, with nothing 
to vary the monotony except an occasional call to test 
the wires. If the wire had been broken I had to have 
it mended by my breakdown squad. Apart from this 
I had nothing to do but wait for the moment of an 
attack. 

The modern battlefield is like a huge, sleeping 
machine with innumerable eyes and ears and arms, 
lying hidden and inactive, ambushed for the one 
moment on which all depends. Then from some 
hole in the ground a single red light ascends in fiery 
prelude. A thousand guns roar out on the instant, and 
at a touch, driven by innumerable levers, the work of 
annihilation goes pounding on its way. 

Orders fly like sparks and flashes over a close net¬ 
work, spurring on to heightened destruction in front 
and bringing up from behind a steady stream of fresh 
men and fresh materials to fling into the flames. Every 
one feels that he is caught in a vortex which draws him 
on and on and thrusts him with unrelenting precision 
over the brink of death. 

Every twenty-four hours I was relieved by another 
officer and betook myself to Nurlu, where fairly 
comfortable quarters had been rigged up in a large wine- 
cellar. I often think of those long, meditative Nov¬ 
ember evenings which I spent smoking my pipe alone 
at the hearth of this barrel-shaped vault, while outside 
the mist dripped from the bare trees in the park and at 
long intervals a re-echoing report broke the stillness. 

On the 18th November the division was relieved and 
I went back to the regiment, now on rest in the village 
of Fresnoy-le-Grand. There I took over the command 



AT ST. PIERRE VAAST 


119 

of the 2nd Company in place of Lieutenant Boje, then 
on leave. The regiment had four weeks of undisturbed 
rest in Fresnoy, and every one did his best to enjoy it to 
the full. Christmas and New Year were celebrated by 
the companies with great festivities at which beer and 
grog flowed in rivers. There were exactly four men 
left in the 2nd Company who had spent the previous 
Christmas with me in the line before Monchy. I was 
billeted on a French rentier, in whose house I shared the 
so-called * salon ’ and two bedrooms with Fahnrich 
Gomick and my brother Fritz, who was spending six 
weeks with the regiment as cadet. We made ourselves 
very merry over the worthy married couple, who kept 
an argus-eyed watch over their plush furniture and 
alabaster vases and over their stack of wood in the yard, 
and who lived on terms of ceaseless animosity with the 
batman. 

In this little retreat the bottle went round faster 
than ever. At night when walking late through the 
narrow streets one heard the sounds of carnival in every 
billet. Everything in wartime goes without reckoning, 
and hence came the preference of the soldier at the 
front for alcohol in its most concentrated forms. Our 
relations with the civil population, too, were, to a great 
extent, of an undesirable familiarity ; Venus deprived 
Mars of many servants. 

Needless to say, we were at once put on a footing 
of old Prussian discipline, and it said a great deal 
for officers and men that after fourteen days the regi¬ 
ment was once more at its old level. 

There was an inspection by the commander of the 
division, Major-General Sontag. On this occasion the 


120 


AT ST. PIERRE VAAST 


regiment was honoured for its valiant conduct in the 
attack on St. Pierre Vaast wood, and distinguished by a 
number of decorations. 

As I marched past the general at the head of the 
2nd Company I observed that Colonel von Oppen 
appeared to make some remark about me to the general. 
A few hours later I received orders to report at divisional 
headquarters, where the general handed me the Iron 
Cross of the ist class. 

On the 17th January 1917 I was sent from Fresnoy 
on a four weeks’ company commanders’ course at 
Sisonne near Laon, where there was a French man¬ 
oeuvring ground. Captain Funk, who was in com¬ 
mand of our detachment, made the work exceedingly 
pleasant. He understood to an exceptional degree how 
to put the spirit above the letter and to interest us in 
the matters in hand. 

The catering was certainly the sorriest I ever ex¬ 
perienced in the course of the war. During the whole 
four weeks there was seldom anything put on the table 
of our gigantic messroom but watery boiled swedes. 
At the same time the work was by no means light. 



THE SOMME RETREAT 


O N my return to the regiment, which had for 
(some days been in the line near the ruins 
of Villers-Carbonnel, I was given temporary 
command of the 8th Company. Our rest-place was 
Devise. 

On the march from there to the line one had to cross 
the plain of the Somme near the villages of Brie and 
St. Christ. The dreary devastation of these places 
in the midst of the melancholy marsh country used 
to put me in a peculiarly sorrowful mood as dark 
fragments of cloud chased across a moonlit sky, and 
the eerie interplay of light and shadow heightened the 
impression of chaos. 

During the latter part of the time our front was 
exposed to numerous English attacks, connected with 
the great evacuation of the Somme area, for which we 
had made the most careful preparations. The enemy 
raided nearly every morning to ascertain whether we 
were still there. The following are a few of the 
experiences of those days. 

ist March 1917. During the morning there was 
great artillery activity owing to the clear weather. In 
particular a heavy battery, with the help of balloon 
observation, pretty well flattened the section of 
trench occupied by No. 3 platoon of my company. 
In the afternoon, in order to mark up any alteration of 
the line on my map, I splashed along to No. 3 platoon 

through the utterly waterlogged ‘ unnamed trench.’ 

lai 



122 THE SOMME RETREAT 

On the way I saw a giant yellow sun rush down to 
the ground trailing a black streamer behind it. An 
airman had attacked the unpleasant balloon and shot 
it down in flames. He got back in spite of a storm 
of fire. 

In the evening Lance-corporal Schnau came to 
report that he had detected a sound of pickaxes, for 
four days past, underneath his section’s dugout. I 
forwarded the report, and was sent a pioneer detach¬ 
ment with a listening apparatus, but our suspicions 
were not confirmed. Later we heard that our whole 
position had been undermined. 

On the 5th March a patrol approached our trench 
in the early morning and began to cut our wire. 
Lieutenant Eisen with a few men hurried off to 
warn the nearest post, and threw bombs. The enemy 
patrol then took to flight, leaving two men behind 
them. One, a young lieutenant, died immediately; 
the other, a sergeant, was severely wounded in the arm 
and leg. It appeared from papers found on the 
officer that he belonged to the Royal Munster Fusiliers. 
He was very well clothed, and his features, though 
distorted in death, were intelligent and energetic. It 
affected me to find the addresses of several London 
girls in his pocket-book. We buried him behind our 
trench, and put a simple cross at his head. I saw 
from this that all patrols need not end so fortunately 
as mine had done in days past. 

Next morning the English, after a short artillery 
preparation, attacked the front of the next company, 
commanded by Lieutenant Reinhardt, with fifty 
men. The enemy crept up to the wire. Then one 



THE SOMME RETREAT 123 

of them, who had a striker attached to his cuff, 
made a light-signal in order to silence the English 
machine-guns, and the whole party threw their last 
bombs and advanced on the trench. The men re¬ 
ceived them in such a masterly fashion that only one 
of them got into the trench. He ran straight through 
to the second line, and there, when he made no reply 
to the summons to give himself up, he was shot. Only 
a lieutenant and a sergeant got through the wire. The 
officer, though he wore a steel shirt under his uniform, 
was accounted for by a bullet point-blank from Rein¬ 
hardt’s revolver that drove a whole steel plate into his 
body. The sergeant had both legs nearly tom off by 
a bomb ; nevertheless, he clenched his short pipe be¬ 
tween his teeth with stoical calm until he died. Here, 
as always, whenever we encountered the English we 
encountered brave men. 

During the morning of this success I was strolling 
through the trench and saw Lieutenant Pfaffendorf, 
who was controlling the fire of his trench-mortar with 
a periscopic telescope from a fire-step. I had scarcely 
joined him when I saw an Englishman walking along 
over the top behind the third line of the enemy trenches. 
His khaki uniform showed up distinctly on the horizon. 
I seized the nearest rifle, sighted it at 600, got the man 
in the tip of the foresight, and then, aiming a bit in 
front of his head, I pulled the trigger. He went three 
steps, and then fell on his back as though his legs had 
been knocked from under him. After a few move¬ 
ments of his arms he rolled into a shell-hole, where, 
with the glass, we could see his brown sleeves show¬ 
ing up for a long while after.

THE SOMME RETREAT 


On the 9th of March our front was properly plastered 
with shells. I was awakened in the early morning by 
the heavy firing, and, seizing my revolver, went, dazed 
with sleep, into the trench. When I pulled aside the 
ground-sheet at the top of the dugout steps, it was still 
as black as pitch. The bright flashes of the guns and 
the showers of earth woke me up in no time. I ran 
through the trench, but not a soul did I see till I came 
to a deep dugout, where a group of men crowded on 
the steps like hens crowding together in the rain, 
with no one in command. On such occasions the 
Prussian way is the best. Pitch into the men, and so 
get yourself going too. I took them with me, and soon 
made the trench look lively. I was delighted to hear 
little Hambrock’s piping voice somewhere along the 
trench, occupied in the same way as I was. 

When the firing died down, I went back to my dug- 
out in a bad temper, and there I was further ruffled 
by a telephone call from headquarters : 

4 What the hell is up ? Why have you been all this 
time coming to the ’phone ? 5 

Keeping in touch is no doubt most important, but 
fighting, after all, is action first and last. 

After breakfast there was more of it. This time 
H.Es. were slowly but incessantly being * plonked 
down 9 in front of our noses. At last it became boring, 
so I paid little Hambrock a visit by an underground 
gallery, and, after seeing what he had to drink, sat down 
with him to a game of ‘ seven and four.’ We were a 
little upset once by a giant crash. It sounded as though 
a drunken gang came tumbling over each other down 
the steps. Lumps of earth clattered through the door 



THE SOMME RETREAT 


and down the stove-pipe. The dugout shaft had got 
hit, and the timber revetment was shivered to match- 
wood. Sometimes a suffocating smell of bitter almonds 
blew down the shaft. Were they shooting prussic acid 
at us ? Well, good luck to them. I had to leave the 
dugout once—indeed, I made four attempts in all, 
owing to constant interruption by the shells. Immedi¬ 
ately after, the batman bounced in with the announce¬ 
ment that the latrine had disappeared beneath a direct 
hit. • Well/ said Hambrock, * you do have the devil’s 
own luck! ’ 

The fire ceased towards evening. I went along the 
trench in the mood I always experienced after being 
heavily shelled, a mood like the relief one feels after a 
violent storm. The trench looked pretty bad ; stretches 
of it were entirely filled in. Five dugout shafts were 
smashed up. Several men were wounded. I went to 
see them and found them all fairly comfortable. There 
was one man killed. His body lay in the trench 
covered with a ground-sheet. A long splinter had 
torn his left hip away, though he was standing right at 
the bottom of the dugout steps. 

In the morning we were relieved. On the 13th 
I was entrusted by Colonel von Oppen with the 
honourable task of holding the company front with a 
patrol of two sections until the whole regiment had 
crossed the Somme. Each of the four sectors of our 
front was to be held by a similar patrol under the 
command of an officer. The officers, starting from 
the right flank, were Reinhardt, Fischa, Lorek, and 
myself. 

The villages we passed through as we marched to the 



126 


THE SOMME RETREAT 


front line had the appearance of lunatic asylums let 
loose. Whole companies were pushing walls down or 
sitting on the roofs of the houses throwing down the 
slates. Trees were felled, window-frames broken, and 
smoke and clouds of dust rose from heap after heap of 
rubbish. In short, an orgy of destruction was going on. 
The men were chasing round with incredible zeal, 
arrayed in the abandoned wardrobes of the population, 
in women’s dresses and with top hats on their heads. 
With positive genius they singled out the main beams 
of the houses and, tying ropes round them, tugged with 
all their might, shouting out in time with their pulls, till 
the whole house collapsed. Others swung hammers 
and smashed whatever came in their way, from flower¬ 
pots on the window ledges to the glass-work of con¬ 
servatories. 

Every village up to the Siegfried line was a rubbish- 
heap. Every tree felled, every road mined, every well 
fouled, every water-course dammed, every cellar blown 
up or made into a death-trap with concealed bombs, 
all supplies or metal sent back, ail rails ripped up, all 
telephone wire rolled up, everything burnable burned. 
In short, the country over which the enemy were to 
advance had been turned into an utter desolation. 

The moral justification of this has been much dis¬ 
cussed. However, it seems to me that the gratified 
approval of arm-chair warriors and journalists is in¬ 
comprehensible. When thousands of peaceful persons 
are robbed of their homes, the self-satisfaction of power 
may at least keep silence. 

As for the necessity, I have of course, as a Prussian 
officer, no doubt whatever. War means the destruc- 



THE SOMME RETREAT 


127 

tion of the enemy without scruple and by any means. 
War is the harshest of all trades, and the masters of it 
can only entertain humane feelings so long as they do 
no harm. It makes no difference that these operations 
which the situation demanded were not very pretty. 

On the 13 th I took over with my two sections the 
front that the 2nd Company now left to me. During 
the night a man with the ominous name of Kirchhof 
was killed by a shot through the head. This unlucky 
shot happened to be the only one fired by the enemy 
during several hours. 

I did all I could to deceive the enemy as to our 
strength. A few shovelfuls of earth were thrown over the 
top, now at one point, now at another, and our machine- 
gun had to fire a few shots first from the left, then from 
the right. Nevertheless, our fire sounded extremely 
thin when a low-flying scout crossed the line or a work¬ 
ing party traversed our front behind the enemy’s 
trenches. Consequently, patrols appeared every night 
at one point or another and set to work tampering with 
our wire. 

On the last day but one I nearly met a sorrowful end. 
A dud shell from an anti-aircraft gun came hurtling 
down and exploded on the traverse against which I 
was innocently leaning. The rush of air sent me flying 
into the entrance of a deep dugout exactly opposite, 
where I came to in a state of utter stupefaction. 

On the 17th, in the early morning, we could tell that 
an attack was imminent. In the English front line, 
usually unoccupied owing to the mud, was to be heard 
the clatter of many feet. The laughter and shouting 
showed that they were a strong party and well fortified 



128 THE SOMME RETREAT 

from within. Presently dark figures approached our 
wire. They dispersed under our fire, and one collapsed 
with a cry and was left behind. I withdrew my men 
to the entrance of a communication trench, and was kept 
busy in illuminating our front, now suddenly under 
artillery and trench-mortar fire, with Verey lights. As 
the white soon gave out, we made a fireworks display 
with coloured ones. When five o’clock came, the hour 
at which, according to orders, we were to evacuate the 
trench, we quickly blew up the dugouts with bombs, 
in so far as they were not already provided with infernal 
machines, some of which we had ingeniously con¬ 
structed. During the last hours I had not dared to 
touch any box or door or bucket in case I might 
go up in the air. 

At the appointed time all the patrols, some of them 
already involved in bombing engagements, retreated 
towards the Somme. We were the last to cross the 
river, and then the bridges were blown up by an engineer 
detachment. The drum-fire still raged away on our 
front, and it was some hours later when the first enemy 
patrols appeared on the Somme. We retired behind the 
Siegfried position, then still being constructed. The 
battalion was quartered in the village of Lehaucourt on 
the St. Quentin Canal. I occupied, with my batman, 
a comfortable little cottage where the household goods 
were still stored away in chests and cupboards. I 
should like to put on record, to show what sort of 
fellows ours were, that nothing I could say would induce 
my batman, the trusty Knigge, to make his bed in the 
warm sitting-room. He insisted all the time on sleep¬ 
ing in the cold kitchen. This attitude of reserve which 



THE SOMME RETREAT 129 

is typical of the Lower Saxon made the relations 
between officer and men work very smoothly. 

The first evening out on rest I invited a party of my 
fellow-officers to drink mulled wine spiced with all the 
spices left behind by the owner of the house ; for our 
rearguard had earned the praise of all our superior 
officers, and fourteen days’ leave as well. 



IN THE VILLAGE OF FRESNOY 


M Y leave, on which I went a few days later, was 
this time not curtailed. I find in my diary 
this brief but eloquent record : * Leave spent 
very happily. Need have no reproaches on that score 
after my death.’ On the 9th April 1917 I returned to 
the 2nd Company, then quartered in the village of 
Merignies, not far from Douai. The pleasure of my 
return was dashed by an unexpected alarm which had 
for me the peculiarly unpleasant consequence that I had 
to ride the company charger to Beaumont. Through 
rain and sleet I rode at the head of the transport, that 
slipped all over the paved road, till we reached our 
destination at one in the morning. 

When I had seen to my horse and the men as well as 
I could, I went in search of quarters for myself; but 
there was not an unoccupied corner to be found. At 
last a commissariat orderly had the excellent idea of 
offering me his bed, as he had to sit up for the telephone 
calls. While I was pulling off my boots and spurs he 
told me that the English had captured Vimy Ridge and 
a lot of ground from the Bavarians. 

I could not help observing, in spite of his hospitality, 
that he was not at all pleased to find his quiet village 
headquarters turned into an assembly-point for the 
fighting troops. 

The next morning the battalion marched in the 
direction of heavy firing to the village of Fresnoy. 
There I received orders to set up an observation post. 

iso 



IN THE VILLAGE OF FRESNOY 


131 

I took a few men and explored the western outskirts of 
the village and found a cottage, in whose roof I had a 
look-out post made that commanded the front. We 
took the cellar as our dwelling-place, and in the course 
of making room there we came upon a sack of potatoes, 
a very welcome addition to our scanty provisions. My 
batman now roasted me potatoes every evening, with 
salt. Lieutenant Gornick also, like a true friend, sent 
me a large parcel of Leberwurst and some red wine. 
He had found them among the stores left behind in haste 
in Villerval, which had already been evacuated, but 
which Gornick was holding as an outpost with one 
platoon. I at once equipped an expedition furnished 
with perambulators and similar means of transport to 
secure this treasure. Unfortunately it returned empty- 
handed, as the English were already in full strength on 
the edge of the village. Gornick told me later that 
after the discovery of a large cellar of red wine a drink¬ 
ing bout had started, which, in spite of the attack then 
being made on the village, it had been extremely 
difficult to bring to a close. 

On the 14th of April I was given the task of organiz¬ 
ing an intelligence clearing-station in the village. For 
this purpose I had despatch-riders, bicyclists, telephone 
and light-signal stations, underground telegraph wires, 
carrier pigeons, and a chain of Verey-light posts placed 
at my disposal. I looked out a suitable cellar, with 
a deep dugout, and returned for the last time to my 
dwelling-place on the western edge of the village. 

During the night I fancied I heard a crash now 
and then and shouts from my batman, but I was so 
dazed with sleep that I only murmured, * Oh, let them 



13a IN THE VILLAGE OF FRESNOY 

shoot! * and turned over, though the whole place was 
thick with dust. Next morning I was awakened by 
little Schultz, Colonel von Oppen’s nephew, who was 
shouting, 4 I say—don’t you know yet that your whole 
house has been blown to blazes ? ’ 

When I got up and surveyed the damage, I observed 
that a shell of the heaviest calibre had been planted on 
the roof, and that the observation post, indeed the whole 
house, was no more. If the velocity had only been a 
trifle slower the hit would have got us in the cellar and 
plastered the walls with us, so that in the nice saying of 
the trenches we might have been 4 scraped off with a 
spoon and buried in the pot.’ Schultz told me that 
his orderly said to him when he saw the ruins of the 
house : 4 There was a lieutenant in there yesterday. 
Better have a look and see whether he is there still.’ 
My batman was beside himself at the way I had slept 
through it. 

During the morning we shifted our quarters into the 
new cellar. On the way we were nearly hit by the church 
tower, which the engineers were unobtrusively blowing 
up in order to deprive the enemy of an easy mark. In 
a neighbouring village they had forgotten to warn a 
post of two men who were keeping a look-out from the 
top of the tower there. By a miracle they were retrieved 
uninjured from the debris. 

We furnished our roomy cellar very passably, for we 
collected what we required from mansion or cottage, 
and what we had no use for we burned in the stove. 

During the first day there was a succession of duels 
to the death in the air. They ended nearly every time 
in the defeat of the English, as Richthofen’s battle 



IN THE VILLAGE OF FRESNOY 


133 


formation was circling over the neighbourhood. Often 
five or six machines were driven down or shot down in 
flames. Once we saw the pilot thrown from his 
machine and fall to the earth as a separate black speck. 
There were dangers, too, in staring up into the sky. A 
man of the 4th Company was killed by a falling splinter 
that hit him in the neck. 

On the 18th April I paid a visit to the and Company 
in the line. It held a salient in front of the village of 
Arleux. Lieutenant Boje told me that he had only 
had a single casualty for a long while, as the English 
shelling was so methodical that it allowed them to side¬ 
step and avoid it every time. 

After I had wished him all the best, I had to leave the 
village at the gallop, on account of the continuous 
shooting by the enemy’s heavy guns. I stopped 300 
metres behind Arleux to watch the clouds that rose 
from each hit. They were red or black according to 
whether brick walls had been pounded or garden soil 
flung up ; and among them was the delicate white of 
exploding shrapnel. When a few ‘whizz-bangs ’ began 
falling on the footpaths that connected Arleux with 
Fresnoy, I abandoned the pursuit of further impressions 
and decamped at full speed, in case I might be ‘slain/ 
as the stock phrase then was in the 2nd Company. 

I was often making expeditions of this kind, some¬ 
times as far as the little town of H&iin-Li&ard, for 
during the first fourteen days, in spite of my large staff, 
there was not a single report to communicate. 

From the 20th April Fresnoy was shelled by a 30*5 
centimetre gun. The shells came over with a perfectly 
infernal hiss. After each hit the village was veiled in a 



134 


IN THE VILLAGE OF FRESNOY 


huge reddish-brown cloud of picric-acid gas. Even 
the duds caused a small earthquake. A man of the 
9th Company, who was surprised by one of them in the 
courtyard of the chateau, was flung over the trees in the 
park and broke most of his bones in the fall. 

In the afternoon the village was shelled with all 
calibres. In spite of the danger I could not tear myself 
from the attic windows of my house. It was a breath¬ 
less sight to see how small parties and despatch-carriers 
chased over the shelled area, often throwing themselves 
flat, while the ground was flung up on every side of 
them. 

When I went into the village after this, one more 
cellar had been hit and set on fire. The salvage opera¬ 
tions recovered only three bodies. Near the cellar lay 
one on its face, with the uniform in shreds. The head 
was torn off and the blood flowed into a puddle of water. 
When the stretcher-bearer turned the body over to 
remove any valuables I could not help seeing that on 
the stump of the arm there was only a thumb. 

The enemy artillery became more active every day 
and left no doubt of an early attack. On the 27th April 
at midnight I had the following telephone message : 
* 67 from 5 a.m., ? which meant in our code, 1 Utmost 
readiness for an alarm from 5 a.m.* 

So I lay down again, hoping to be all the better pre¬ 
pared for the expected exertions. However, as I was 
just falling asleep a shell hit the house and blew in the 
wall of the cellar stairs and threw the masonry into the 
cellar. We jumped up and hurried into the dugout. 

As we crouched on the steps in the light of a candle, 
disconcerted and weary, the sergeant of my light- 



IN THE VILLAGE OF FRESNOY 


135 

signalling section, whose post, together with two valu¬ 
able signalling lamps, had been smashed up in the 
afternoon, came rushing in. * Sir, the cellar of No. 11 
has had a direct hit and some of the men are still buried 
in the ruins.’ As I had two cyclists and three tele¬ 
phonists in No. 11 ,1 took some men and hurried to 
their help. 

I found a lance-corporal and a wounded man in the 
dugout, and was given the following account. When 
the shells began to fall suspiciously near, four of the 
five occupants of the cellar decided to go down into the 
dugout shaft. One of them went straight away, one 
stayed where he was in bed, while the remaining three 
delayed to pull on their boots. The most prudent and 
the least, as so often in war, came off the best: the first 
had not a scratch, and the second had a splinter in the 
thigh. The three others were caught by the shell, 
which came through the cellar wall and exploded in 
the opposite comer. 

After this narration I lit a cigar and went into the 
smoke-filled cellar. In the middle of it there was a 
heap of wreckage—bedsteads, straw mattresses, and 
various pieces of furniture, all in fragments and piled 
nearly up to the roof. After we had put a few candles 
on ledges of the walls, we set to work. Catching hold of 
the limbs that stuck out from the wreckage, we pulled 
out the dead bodies. One had the head struck off, and 
the neck on the trunk was like a great sponge of blood. 
From the arm stumps of another the broken bones 
projected, and the uniform was saturated by a large 
wound in the chest. The entrails of the third poured 
out from a wound in the belly. As we pulled out the 



136 IN THE VILLAGE OF FRESNOY 

last a splintered board caught in the ghastly wound 
with a hideous noise. The orderly made a comment 
on this, and was reproved by my batman with these 
words : ‘ Best hold your tongue. In such matters 
talking nonsense serves no purpose/ 

I took an inventory of the valuables found on them. 
It was a horrible job. The candles flickered red in the 
vaporous air, and as the two men handed me pocket- 
books and silver objects it seemed as though we were 
engaged in some dark and secret work. The fine 
yellow plaster-dust fell on the faces of the dead and gave 
them the fixed look of wax figures. We threw cover¬ 
ings over them and hurried out of the cellar, after taking 
up the wounded man in a ground-sheet. With the 
stoical advice to set his teeth, we carried him through 
a whirl of shrapnel fire to the dressing-station dugout. 

When I got back to my dwelling-place the first thing 
I did was to have a few cherry-brandies. The experi¬ 
ence I had been through had touched my nerve. Soon 
we were being violently shelled once more, and with the 
example before our eyes of what artillery fire can do in 
cellars we made all speed into the dugout shaft. 

At 5.15 a.m. the fire increased to an incredible 
violence. Our dugout rocked and trembled like a ship 
on a stormy sea. All round resounded the rending 
of masonry and the crash of collapsing houses. 

At 7 a.m. I received a message by light-signal 
addressed to the 2nd Battalion : * Brigade requires 
immediate report on the situation/ After an hour a 
despatch-carrier brought back the news : ‘ Enemy 
taken Arleux and Arleux park. Ordered 8th Company to 
counter-attack. No news so far. Rocholl, Captain/ 



IN THE VILLAGE OF FRESNOY 


137 


This was the only message that my tremendous 
apparatus of transmission had to deal with during all 
three weeks of my time in Fresnoy—though certainly 
it was a very important one. And now that my 
activity was of the utmost value, the artillery fire had 
put nearly the whole organization out of action. Such 
were the results of over-centralization. 

This surprising information explained why we had 
heard rifle-bullets, fired at no very great range, clatter¬ 
ing against the walls of the houses. 

We had scarcely realized the great losses suffered 
by the regiment, when the shelling was renewed with 
increasing fury. My batman was standing, the last 
of all, on the top step of the dugout stairs, when a crash 
like thunder announced that the English had at last 
succeeded in knocking in our cellar. The trusty 
Knigge got a good squared building-stone on the back, 
but was not hurt. Above, everything was shot to 
blazes. Daylight came to us past two bicycles squeezed 
into the dugout entrance. We made ourselves as 
small as we could on the lowest step, while heavy 
explosions and the din of falling masonry convinced 
us of the insecurity of our refuge. 

By a miracle the telephone was still working, so I 
explained the plight we were in to my chief at the 
Division, and received orders to withdraw with my men 
into the dressing-station dugout close by. 

After packing up what it was most essential to take 
with us, we set about leaving the dugout by the second 
and only remaining exit. In spite of my peremptory 
orders, backed up by unequivocal threats, the tele¬ 
phone staff, which was not much used to war, hesitated 



138 IN THE VILLAGE OF FRESNOY 

so long to venture out of the protection of the dugout 
into the shell-fire that this exit, too, was smashed in 
with a crash by a heavy shell. Luckily, no one was 
hit; only our little dog howled miserably, and from 
that moment was never seen again. 

We now pushed aside the bicycles that barred the 
way out through the cellar, and, creeping on all-fours 
over the heaps of debris, got into the open through a 
narrow crack in the wall. We did not pause to observe 
the incredible change that these few hours had pro¬ 
duced in the village, but ran out of it as fast as we could. 
The last of us had scarcely left the yard gates when the 
house got another tremendous hit. 

A compact belt of fire covered the area between the 
edge of the village and the dressing-station dugout. 
Light and heavy shells with direct and delay action 
fuses, duds, empty cases, and shrapnel combined to 
produce a nightmare of acoustic and optical effects. 
Through it, passing to right and left of the witch’s 
cauldron seething in the village, the reserves were 
marching up. 

In Fresnoy the shells were sending up the earth in 
fountains as high as church towers. Each seemed 
bent on outdoing its predecessor. As though by magic, 
one house after another was sucked into the earth. 
Walls collapsed, gables fell, and bare rafters were flung 
through the air to mow the roofs of neighbouring 
houses. Clouds of splinters danced above whitish 
swathes of vapour. Eye and ear hung as though 
entranced upon this dance of destruction. 

We spent two days in a painfully confined space 
in the dressing-station dugout, for besides my men 



IN THE VILLAGE OF FRESNOY 


139 


there were the staffs of two battalions, two relief 
detachments, and the indispensable corps troops. 
Naturally, the constant coming and going in front of 
the entrances was observed by the enemy. Soon the 
range was got to a yard, and at intervals of a minute 
shells fell on the track outside, and there were casual¬ 
ties all the time. Indeed, the shouts for stretcher- 
bearers never ceased. I lost four bicycles which we 
had left outside, owing to this disagreeable bombard¬ 
ment. They were scattered to the four winds, in 
various states of contortion. 

Stark and still, and wrapped in a ground-sheet, 
Lieutenant Lemtere, the commander of the 8th Com¬ 
pany, lay at the entrance, his large horn spectacles still 
on his nose. His men had brought him there. He 
was shot in the mouth. His younger brother was 
killed a few months later in exactly the same way. 

On the 30th April I handed over to my successor 
of the 25th Regiment, by whom we were relieved. We 
made our way to Flers, the rendezvous of the 1st Bat¬ 
talion. Leaving the much-shelled limekilns, * Chez 
bon temps,’ on our left, we went quickly on through 
the afternoon sunshine along the path to Beaumont. 
Our eyes rejoiced again in the beauty of the earth. 
We drew in the intoxicating breath of spring, thank¬ 
ful to have escaped the intolerably crowded confine¬ 
ment of the dugout. With the thunder of the guns in 
our rear, my sympathies were with the poet: 

' Surely the day that God has given 
Has better uses than to kill.’ 

In Flers I found the quarters allotted me in the 



IN THE VILLAGE OF FRESNOY 


140 

possession of some staff sergeant-majors, who, under 
the pretext that they had to keep the room for a certain 
Baron von X, refused to give it up to me. They 
failed, however, to reckon with the overstrained nerves 
of a worn-out front-line soldier. I told my men to 
smash in the door, and after a brief hand-to-hand 
engagement, under the eyes of the owner of the house, 
who, much alarmed, hastened on to the scene in his 
dressing-gown, we sent the gentlemen flying down the 
stairs. My batman carried politeness to such lengths 
that he threw their trench boots after them. After 
this assault I took possession of the warm bed, sur¬ 
rendering half of it to my friend Kius, who was wander¬ 
ing round without a billet. Sleeping in a bed after 
so long a time did us so much good that we woke 
next morning in all our 4 pristine vigour.’ 

As the 1st Battalion had come off the lightest in the 
casualties of the recent days of fighting, we were in 
excellent trim as we marched to Douai station. From 
there we went by train to the junction of Busigny. We 
were to have some days’ rest in Serain, a village in the 
neighbourhood. The population was friendly, and 
we had good quarters. On the very first evening the 
sounds of happy forgathering were to be heard from 
many of the houses. 

These drink-offerings on the morrow of well-fought 
fights count among an old soldier’s happiest memories. 
And though ten out of twelve had fallen, still the last 
two, as sure as death, were to be found on the first 
evening of rest over the bottle, drinking a silent health 
to their dead companions, talking and laughing over 
all they had been through. For dangers past— 




IN THE VILLAGE OF FRESNOY 141 

an old soldier’s laugh. For those to come—a full 
glass, though death and the devil grin there, as long as 
the wine was good. Such has ever been the custom 
of war. 

It was the officers’ mess more than all that made me 
appreciate this. It was here, among the spirits of the 
undaunted dead, that the will to conquer was concen¬ 
trated and made visible in the features of each weather¬ 
beaten face. There was an element at work here that 
the very horror of the war underlined and even spirit¬ 
ualized, an element one seldom found among the men 
with whom one lay in the shell-holes—sporting joy 
in danger, and a chivalrous impulse to see things 
out. And to say the least of it, I have never in this 
much-reviled circle heard one faint-hearted word. 

My batman came next morning and read me the 
orders. From these it appeared that I was to take 
command of the 4th Company. It was in this com¬ 
pany, in the autumn of 1914, that Hermann Lons, the 
Lower Saxon poet, fell.

O N the 6th May 1917 we were once more on the 
I march to the now familiar Brancourt, and on 
the following day we went through Mont- 
brehain, Ramicourt, and Joncourt into the Siegfried 
line, which we had left just a month before. 

The first evening was stormy. Heavy rain pattered 
down without ceasing on to the flooded ground. Soon, 
however, a succession of bright, warm days reconciled 
us to our new station. I enjoyed the wonderful 
country undisturbed by the white puffs of shrapnel and 
the leaping cones of the shell-bursts ; indeed, I scarcely 
noticed them. In those years of increased activity the 
signs of an offensive were as much a part of the spring 
as primroses and opening buds. 

Our lines formed a crescent in front of the St. 
Quentin Canal. Behind us was the famous Siegfried 
line. I never could tell why we had to occupy the 
narrow, unfinished trenches in the chalk, when behind 
us lay this magnificent line. 

The front line wound through an idyllic meadowland 
shadowed by small groups of trees and beautified now 
by the tender colours of spring. We could move about 
with impunity behind and in front of the trench, for 
our front was protected by a belt of outposts pushed 
forward to a depth of a kilometre. These posts were a 
thorn in the enemy’s side, and not a night went by for 
many weeks that he did not try to dislodge them either 
by cunning or force.

Our first spell in the line was, however, passed in 
welcome quiet. The weather was so fine that the men 
slept out on the grass. On the 14th May we were 
relieved by the 8th Company and, leaving the burning 
St. Quentin on our right, proceeded to our rest-place, 
Montbr&iain, a large village that so far had suffered 
very little from the war and therefore had very com¬ 
fortable quarters to offer. On the 20th, as company in 
reserve, we occupied the Siegfried line. The weather 
was gorgeous, and day after day we sat in the numerous 
arbours built in the side of the trench, or bathed in the 
canal, or boated on it. 

The objection to occupying a trench otherwise so 
ideal lies in the frequent visits from superior officers, 
a pleasure very little esteemed in the line. In any case 
my left wing had no cause to complain of being too safe. 
It extended nearly to the village of Bellenglise, already 
seriously nibbled at, and on the very first day one of 
my men got a shrapnel-bullet wound in the right 
buttock. When I hastened to the scene of the disaster, 
he was seated in great content on his left side awaiting 
the stretcher-bearers, and filling in the time with an 
enormous slice of bread and jam. 

On the 25th May we relieved the 12th Company in 
Riqueval farm. This farm, formerly a large estate, was 
occupied in turns by each of the four companies in the 
line. There were three machine-gun positions at 
different points in our rear, and these had to be manned 
by sections in rotation. These strong points distri¬ 
buted behind the line, and covering each other like 
squares on a chess-board, were the first experiment in 
an elastic scheme of defence. 



*44 


AGAINST INDIANS 


The rest of the men were sent forward on working 
parties every night. 

The farm lay 1500 metres at most behind the front 
line. Nevertheless the buildings, surrounded by a well- 
timbered park, were still entirely intact. As there were 
deep dugouts under construction, there were plenty of 
men there. The red may-tree avenues in the park and 
the charm of the surroundings gave our life there some¬ 
thing of the cheerful enjoyment which the Frenchman 
means by his * vie de champagne/ in spite of the near¬ 
ness to the front. A pair of swallows had nested in my 
bedroom. Before it was light they started on the noisy 
business of feeding their brood. 

In the evenings I took my stick from the corner and 
wandered along the narrow paths that went up and 
down through the hilly country. The neglected fields 
were scented with wildflowers. Here and there single 
trees stood by the wayside. In peace time the labourers 
must often have rested beneath them. They had an 
air of enchantment, standing alone in the solitude, 
covered with blossom white or pink or red. It seemed 
that the war had thrown a heroic and melancholy 
light over the landscape, and without disturbing its 
loveliness added a ray to its brightness and a strength 
to its spell. 

It is easier to go into the battle in the midst of such 
beauties of nature than when surrounded by a dead and 
cold winter landscape. Somehow, it comes to one 
quite simply that one's existence is part of an eternal 
circuit, and that the death of a single individual is no 
such great matter. 

On the 30th May this idyll came to an end as far as I 






AGAINST INDIANS 


J 4S 

was concerned, for the command of the 4th Company 
was taken over again by Lieutenant Vogeley, who had 
come out of hospital. I rejoined my old 2nd Company, 
now under the command of a cavalry lieutenant, in 
the line. 

Our front, extending from the Roman road to the 
so-called Artillery trench, was held by two platoons. 
The third, with company headquarters, was about 200 
metres to the rear behind a small hill. There was 
a little wooden hut there, too, that I used to occupy 
with Lieutenant Kius, peacefully relying upon the 
poor shooting of the English artillery. 

One side of it was built into the slope of a little 
hill facing the enemy; the three others trustingly 
offered themselves as a mark. Every day, when the 
morning’s greetings came hurtling across, the following 
dialogue might be heard between the occupants of the 
upper and lower bunks : 

‘ That you, Ernst ? ’ 

‘Hm.’ 

‘ They ’re shooting, aren’t they ? ’ 

‘ Well, let’s lie where we are a little longer. I think 
those were the last ones.’ 

After a quarter of an hour : 

* That you, Oskar ? ’ 

‘ Yes ? ’ 

‘ They are not going to stop to-day. I think that 
was a shrapnel bullet that came through the wall just 
now. We’d better get up. That artillery observer 
fellow cleared out long ago.* 

We had always optimistically taken off our boots. 
By the time we were ready, the shooting had generally

left off, and we could seat ourselves happily at the 
absurdly small table and drink coffee that the heat had 
turned sour, and light our morning cigars. In the 
afternoon, in scorn of the English artillery, we used 
to have sun-baths on a ground-sheet in front of the 
door. 

Our cabin was extremely entertaining in other re¬ 
spects too. When one lay in sweet idleness on the wire 
mattress, gigantic earth-worms hung pendulum-wise 
from the earth wall and shot into their holes with 
inconceivable rapidity at the least touch. A peevish 
mole sniffed about from his tunnel and added much to 
the enlivenment of our prolonged siesta. 

On the 12th of June I had to occupy the outpost on 
the company front with twenty men. It was late when 
we left the trench and went in the warm evening air by 
the footpath winding over the undulating ground. 
Dusk was so far advanced that the red poppies in the 
untilled fields blended with the vivid green grass to an 
extraordinarily rich tone. 

We strolled silently along over the carpet of flowers. 
Each man was busy with his own thoughts ; our rifles 
hung from our shoulders ; and in twenty minutes we 
arrived at our destination. In whispers the post was 
taken over. Silently guards were mounted. Then the 
men we relieved disappeared into the darkness. 

The outpost rested upon a short, steep hill. In the 
rear a wild and tangled wood melted into the night. It 
was separated from our steep bank by about a hundred 
metres of meadow ground. In front and to our right 
rose two hills over which ran the English lines. There 
was a ruin on one with the promising name 1 Ascension 




AGAINST INDIANS 


H7 

farm/ A sunken road ran between these hills to the 
enemy. 

And now, just as my posts had gone out, appeared 
Sergeant-major Hackmann with a few men of the 7th 
Company, just about to go on patrol. I attached 
myself to them as camp-follower, though I had no 
business to leave my post. 

Using a method of advance invented by myself, we 
crossed two entanglements that barred our way and got 
over the crest of the hill without, to our surprise, having 
run into a single outpost. We could now hear English 
working parties to right and to left of us. It was clear 
to me after the event that the enemy had withdrawn his 
own posts so as not to involve them in the fire which, 
as I shall shortly explain, he was about to open on 
ours. 

My method of advance, mentioned just now, con¬ 
sisted in this, that over ground in which we might at 
any moment run up against the enemy each member 
of the patrol crept forward in turn. In this way, only 
one man at a time exposed himself to the risk of being 
shot from an ambush, while the rest, in a body behind, 
lay in readiness to attack. Naturally I took care to 
take my turn as leader, although my mere presence 
with the patrol was bad enough in itself. An officer 
in the front line has often to put himself technically in 
the wrong from considerations of a personal kind. 

We stalked several working parties that, unfortu¬ 
nately, were separated from us by dense entanglements. 
The somewhat eccentric sergeant-major suggested 
giving himself up as a deserter and holding the enemy 
in parley until we had surrounded the first post. This 



AGAINST INDIANS 


148 

plan was turned down after a brief discussion, and we 
crept back, disappointed, to the outpost. 

There I sat down on the edge of the steep bank on 
my cloak, and, lighting a pipe as cautiously as possible, 
I gave rein to my thoughts. In the midst of the most 
beautiful castle in the air, I was suddenly alarmed by 
a peculiar rustling in the wood and the meadow. In 
the face of the enemy the senses are always on the 
look-out; and it is remarkable that, at such moments, 
quite ordinary sounds can give one the instant con¬ 
viction, * Something is up ! * 

At the same instant the nearest post came up to 
me : ‘ Sir, there are seventy Englishmen advancing 
to the edge of the wood.* 

I was rather surprised by the numerical precision, 
but for the sake of prudence I hid myself, with the 
four men nearest me, on the edge of the bank in the 
long grass, in order to observe how matters developed. 
After a few seconds I saw a body of men gliding over 
the meadow. While the men covered them with their 
rifles I called out softly, 1 Who goes there ? * It was 
Teilengerdes, a N.C.O., an old veteran of the 2nd Com¬ 
pany, who was trying to collect his agitated section. 

I at once got them all in hand and formed them in 
line, with one flank on the wood and the other on the 
bank. In a moment, bayonets were fixed. When 
I was giving them directions and told a man who hung 
back to dress up with the rest, ‘ I am a stretcher- 
bearer/ was the answer. The fellow had his drill well 
in his head. Comforted by this triumph of Prussian 
discipline, I gave the word to advance. 

While we were crossing the strip of meadow, a hail 





AGAINST INDIANS 


149 


of shrapnel and a wild clatter of machine-gun fire 
began from the English side. We broke, against our 
wills, into a double, so as to reach the cover of the 
shoulder of the hill that lay to our front. 

Suddenly a dark shadow rose in front of me. I 
seized a bomb and threw it. To my horror I saw in 
the flash of the explosions that it was the N.C.O. 
Teilengerdes, who had got in front unobserved and 
had just been tripped up by a wire. Fortunately he 
was not hurt. At the same time we heard the sharper 
explosion of English bombs not far off, and the shrap¬ 
nel fire increased to an unpleasant intensity. 

My firing-line broke and disappeared in the direc¬ 
tion of the steep bank, which was under heavy fire. I 
with Teilengerdes and three more of the right sort 
stood my ground. Suddenly one of them rushed up 
to me : * The English ! * 

Like a vision engraved for one second on my eyes 
I saw a double row of kneeling figures, at that moment, 
getting up and advancing over the meadow, which was 
lit up only by an occasional flash. I could clearly dis¬ 
tinguish the figure of an officer on the right flank. 
Friend and foe were as though paralysed by this 
abrupt and unexpected encounter. Then we did the 
one thing left us to do—turned and made off before 
the enemy recovered sufficiently to fire a shot. We 
jumped up and ran back to the bank. Though I 
tripped and fell over a treacherous wire stretched 
through the tall grass, I got back without further mis¬ 
adventure. The men were there, but they were in a 
state of great agitation, and it cost me all my energy to 
get them into line, even elbow to elbow.

* 5 ° 

I have always observed that the ordinary man whose 
sole preoccupation is his own danger is surprised by 
what seems to him an undivided attention to the matter 
in hand on the part of the officer in command, who 
among a thousand and one unnerving incidents of 
battle yet keeps his eye fixed upon the execution of 
his duty. This surprise makes an officer excel him¬ 
self and spurs him on to always greater achievements. 
In this way officers and men call out energies in each 
other which would otherwise lie dormant. Indeed 
the moral factor is everything. 

The enemy fire ceased of a sudden, and at the same 
time crackling and rustling sounds were heard in the 
undergrowth of the wood. 

4 Halt! Who goes there ? Password/ 

We kept on calling out for a good five minutes, and 
even shouted the old battle-cry of the ist Battalion, 
‘ Luttje Lage,’ an expression signifying schnaps and 
beer, known to every Hanoverian. Only a strange 
and incomprehensible shout came in reply.' At last 
I took the responsibility on myself and gave the order 
to fire, though some of the men asserted that they had 
heard German words. The fire of twenty rifles swept 
the wood ; bolts rattled ; and soon the cry we had heard 
changed to moans. This gave me a passing twinge 
of uncertainty. However, there were yellow flashes 
here and there in our direction, though they soon died 
away. One of the men was hit in the shoulder, and 
the stretcher-bearers bound him up. 

4 Cease fire ! 9 

Slowly the command took effect and the firing ceased. 
The men had quite recovered their nerve. Once 




AGAINST INDIANS 


more there were calls for the password, and on my 
side the persuasive summons : 4 Come here; you 
are prisoners. Hands up ! ’ 

Thereupon there were confused cries from the other 
side, which were interpreted by the men as 4 Rache ! 
Rache ! * (‘ Revenge ! Revenge ! *) A single figure 
detached itself from the border of the wood and came 
towards us. One of the men was idiot enough to 
shout * Password 9 at him, at which he stopped and 
turned round. 

* Shoot him dead ! 9 

There were a dozen shots, and he sank in a heap 
beneath the tall grass. 

This little episode gave us a feeling of satisfaction. 
Once more confused cries rang out from the edge of 
the wood. It seemed that the attacking party were 
encouraging each other to advance on their mysterious 
enemy. 

In the utmost excitement we kept our eyes fixed on 
the dark strip of ground. It was beginning to dawn, 
and a light mist rose from the meadow-land. 

Then a row of shadows rose out of the darkness. 
Five, ten, fifteen, a whole lot of them. Trembling 
fingers released the safety catches. They were fifty 
metres from us, thirty, fifteen . . . 4 Fire ! * For a 
minute the rifles rattled out. Sparks showered up 
whenever the storm of bullets encountered weapons 
or steel helmets. 

Suddenly there was a shout: * Look out on the left! * 
Coming quickly on, a party of the enemy was attacking 
us on the left flank. At the head of it was a giant 
with outstretched revolver, swinging a white bludgeon. 



AGAINST INDIANS 


152 

* Left section I Left front! * 

The men whipped round and received the new arrivals 
standing. Some of them, and among them their 
leader, fell at the first hurried shots. The rest vanished 
as swiftly as they had come. Now was the moment 
to attack in turn. With fixed bayonets and a rousing 
4 Hurrah ! ’ we stormed the wood. We threw a volley 
of bombs into the tangled undergrowth, and in a 
moment were once more in undisturbed possession 
of our outpost, without having encountered the pliant 
enemy. 

We assembled in a cornfield and looked at each 
other. Our faces had an after-the-night-before look, 
and a lark that rose into the sky and began its trills was 
an added exasperation. We were in much the same 
mood as when, after a night of play, the cards are flung 
on to the table and the windows thrown open to let 
the cool morning air blow away the hanging cloud of 
cigar smoke. 

While we handed round the water-bottles and lit 
cigars we heard the enemy retreating along the sunken 
road and the cries of the wounded they carried with 
them. 

I decided to survey the field of battle. Strange 
sounds and cries of pain came from the meadow where 
we had routed the enemy with our rifle-fire. We found 
a number of dead in the long grass and three wounded 
who begged for mercy. They were convinced we 
would massacre them. 

When I asked, 4 Quelle nation ?’ one of them 
answered, 4 Pauvre Rajput ! 9 

They were Indians, who had come far over the sea

to run their heads against the Hanover Fusiliers in this 
God-forsaken corner of the earth. 

Their fine bodies were in evil plight. At that short 
range infantry fire has an almost explosive effect. 
Many had been hit for the second time when they had 
fallen, so that the track of the bullet passed along the 
whole length of their bodies. Not one had been hit 
less than twice. We took the wounded up and carried 
them to our trench. They cried out as if they were 
being stuck with spears, till the men had to stop their 
mouths and threaten them with their fists ; and at this 
they seemed to be comforted in their anguish. One of 
them died while he was being carried in. He was taken 
on all the same, as there was a prize on the head of every 
prisoner, dead or alive. The two others strove to win 
our indulgence by shouting out all the time, ‘ Anglais 
pas bon 1 * Why these people spoke French I have 
never quite made out. 

The company had heard the sounds of fighting and 
had had a heavy barrage put down on them. They 
welcomed us back to the trench in jubilation and with 
astonishment at our booty. I retired to our cabin 
with Kius and half a dozen more whom he quickly 
enrolled, and was entertained in honour of the occasion 
with poached eggs. 

Our achievement received the notice it deserved, and 
was mentioned in divisional orders with praise. With 
twenty men we had beaten back a detachment many times 
our number, though they had taken us in the rear and 
though our orders were to withdraw if attacked in force. 
Such successes can, of course, only be won by troops 
whose discipline and morale are of the first order. Of 



X S4 


AGAINST INDIANS 


myself I could say with satisfaction that my command 
of the situation and my personal influence with my men 
had prepared a severe disappointment and an early 
grave for the officer who led the attack. We two had 
matched our wits in the same way as is customary in 
field exercises in training—except that we had not 
used dummy cartridges. 

If these lines are read by any one belonging to the 
ist Hariana Lancers I wish to express to him in this 
place my respect for a body of men who could claim 
as their commander such a one as he whom I had 
the honour to fight. 

What does Nietzsche say of fighting men ? ‘You 
must have as enemies only those whom you hate, but 
not those whom you despise. You must be proud of 
your enemy, and then the enemy’s success is your 
success also.’ 

The next evening I had orders again to occupy the 
outpost. It was impossible to occupy it by day, as it 
was in full view of the enemy. Kius and I with fifty 
men took each a side of the wood and met at the 
steep bank. There was nothing to be seen or heard 
of the enemy except that there was a shout and a 
Verey light and a shot from the sunken road which 
Sergeant-major Hackmann and I had reconnoitred. 
We marked this unwary individual down for our 
next expedition. 

At the spot where we had beaten off the flank attack 
the night before were lying three dead. Two of them 
were Indians, and one a white officer with two gold stars 
on his shoulder-straps : a lieutenant, therefore. He 
had been shot in the eye. The bullet went out through

*55 

the opposite temple and had smashed the rim of his 
steel helmet—which is now among my collection 
of sinister trophies. His right hand still grasped the 
club, stained with his own blood ; his left a large Colt 
six-shooter. There were only two live cartridges left 
in the magazine. 

The men plundered the fallen. I have always hated 
the sight; all the same, I did not interfere. What they 
took was otherwise doomed to waste away, and aes¬ 
thetic or moral considerations seemed to me to be out 
of place in this dark meadow-ground over which all the 
callous relentlessness of war still brooded. 

During the following days several more dead bodies 
were found in the undergrowth of the wood; this 
showed how heavy the enemy’s losses had been, and 
made the outpost a rather unpleasant place to be in. 
As I was working my way alone through a thicket I 
heard a peculiar hissing and murmuring sound. I went 
nearer and came upon two corpses in which the heat 
had awakened a ghastly life. 

On the 18th June the outpost was again attacked. 
This time the affair did not go off so well. The men 
broke and could not be rallied again. One, a N.C.O., 
Erdelt, jumped straight off the bank in the confusion. 
He rolled down and landed at the bottom among a 
party of Indians in ambush. He threw bombs, but was 
soon caught by the throat by an Indian officer and 
scourged in the face with a wire whip. His watch 
was taken from him and he was pushed and thumped 
and marched off by his captors. However, he managed 
to escape when the Indians threw themselves down on 
account of our machine-gun fire. After long wander- 



AGAINST INDIANS 


iS6 

mgs behind the enemy’s front he regained our lines, 
with thick weals across his face. 

On the evening of the 18th June I went on patrol 
with little Schultz, ten men, and a light machine-gun. 
We set out from the outpost, now becoming by degrees 
somewhat oppressive, with the aim of paying the post 
that had lately made itself so obvious in the sunken 
road the honour of a visit. Schultz went with his 
party to the right of the sunken road, I to the left, with 
the understanding that if either party were fired on 
the other should run to its help. We worked our 
way forward on hands and knees through grass and 
thickets of broom, pausing now and then to listen. 

Suddenly came the sharp rattle of a rifle-bolt. We 
sank into the ground. Every old hand knows the series 
of feelings that occupied the next seconds. For the 
moment one has lost the initiative and must wait and 
see what the enemy does next. 

A shot broke the oppressive stillness. I lay behind 
a broom-bush and waited. On my right some one 
threw bombs into the sunken road. 

At once a whole line of fire flashed out in front of us. 
The sickening sharpness of the report showed that the 
fire came from only a few yards ahead of us, and, seeing 
that we had stumbled into too hot a corner, I gave the 
word to run for it. We all sprang up and sprinted for 
all we were worth, while rifle-fire was opened on us 
from our left as well. I gave up all hope of a safe 
return when I heard this unholy clatter. Uncon¬ 
sciously, I was in constant expectation of being hit 
Death was out hunting. 

Somewhere near us a detachment advanced to the 






AGAINST INDIANS 


157 

attack with a shrill hurrah. Little Schultz confessed 
to me afterwards that he imagined a lean Indian behind 
him wielding a knife and already clutching him tight 
by the neck. 

I tumbled once and brought down the N.C.O. 
Teilengerdes over on top of me. I lost my steel 
helmet, revolver, and bombs. Anything to get on ! 
At last we reached the protecting bank and tore down it. 
Lieutenant Schultz reached it at the same time with his 
men. He announced quite out of breath that anyway 
he had paid out the cheeky post with bombs. Just 
after two men came in carrying Fusilier F., who was 
wounded in both legs. All the rest were unwounded. 

The worst misfortune was that the man who had 
carried the machine-gun, a recruit, had fallen over the 
wounded man and left the thing behind. While we 
were holding a brief council of war and planning a 
second expedition, the artillery began firing. I was 
reminded very precisely of the night of the 12th, for 
this time too there was a hopeless stampede. I found 
myself alone on the bank with the wounded man, who, 
dragging himself forward by both his hands, implored 
me piteously not to leave him alone. * Don’t leave 
me, sir ! * 

I had to, little as I liked it, in order to take my part in 
putting the outpost in fighting trim. I got the men 
together in a row of shallow firing positions on the edge 
of the wood ; but I confess I was thankful when the 
day dawned without further incident. 

On such occasions I was always surprised and touched 
by the trusting reliance of the men on the ability of the 
officer to cope with the situation. * Where shall we go, 



AGAINST INDIANS 


iS8 

sir ? * ‘ Help, sir, I *m wounded ! * * Where’s the 
officer ? * 

To be in command at such moments and to have a 
clear head is its own supreme reward, just as cowardice 
is its own punishment. I have always pitied the 
coward, in whom battle arouses a series of hellish 
tortures, while the spirit of the brave man merely rises 
the higher to meet a chain of exciting experiences. 

The next night found us at the same spot. Our 
object was to recover our machine-gun. However, a 
succession of suspicious noises as we crept on warned 
us that once more there must be a strong detachment 
on the watch for us. 

It was decided, therefore, in accordance with a point 
of honour which like many others in the war made us 
inwardly curse, to recover the lost weapon by force. 
At 12 midnight, after three minutes’ artillery prepara¬ 
tion, we were to attack the enemy posts and look for 
the gun. 

I put the best face I could on the sorry business, and 
in the afternoon I shot some ranging shots with some 
of the batteries. 

At 11 at night I was once more with Schultz, my 
companion in misfortune, on the uncanny bit of ground 
where I had already passed so many exciting moments. 
The smell of corruption was scarcely endurable in 
the sultry air. We sprinkled the bodies with quick¬ 
lime that we had brought with us in sacks. The 
covering of white shone out like grave-clothes in 
the darkness. 

The enterprise opened with our own machine-gun fire 
whistling between our legs and pattering against the 







AGAINST INDIANS 


159 

bank. On this account Schultz and I had a violent 
altercation, for he himself had given the machine- 
gunners their range. We were reconciled, however, 
when Schultz discovered me behind a bush in close 
confabulation with a bottle of Burgundy that I had 
brought with me to invigorate me for the precarious 
adventure and to calm my nerves, which had been on 
the stretch for nine days past. 

The first shell came along to the minute and landed 
fifty metres behind us. Before we could express our 
surprise at this extraordinary shooting, a second was 
planted close behind us on the bank and showered us 
with earth. It was not for me even to emit a curse, for 
I had myself given the range for the guns. 

After this cheerful opening we advanced more as a 
matter of honour than with any great hopes of success. 
Luckily, the enemy posts had apparently retired. 
Otherwise we might have had a very unpleasant recep¬ 
tion. Unfortunately, we did not find the machine-gun, 
nor did we search for it very long. 

On the way back Schultz and I once more told each 
other what we really thought—I about the way he had 
directed his machine-gun fire, and he about the shooting 
of the guns. I had tested the range so accurately that 
the affair seemed incomprehensible. Later I learned 
that guns always shoot short at night, and that I ought 
to have added a few hundred metres when I gave the 
range. Then we sat down to the most important part 
of the business—the report. We did so well that 
every one was delighted. 

These skirmishings came to an end the next day, 
for we were relieved by another division.

AGAINST INDIANS 


We went back to Montbrdhain for a time, and 
marched from there to Cambrai, where we spent nearly 
the whole of July. 

The outpost was finally lost on the night following 
our relief. 



LANGEMARCK 


C AMBRAI is a quiet, sleepy little town whose 
name calls up many historical associations. 
The narrow, old-world streets twist about 
round the mighty town-hall, the weathered gates, 
and the many churches. Ponderous towers rear 
themselves from a maze of gables. Broad avenues 
lead to the park, which is adorned by a monument to 
the aviator B 16 riot. 

The inhabitants are peaceful, friendly folk who lead 
a comfortable bourgeois life in the large houses which 
are simple to look at but richly furnished. Many 
retired people settle here. The town is rightly called 
‘ la ville des millionaires,’ for there were over forty 
millionaires there just before the war. 

The war broke its enchanted sleep with brutal 
suddenness and turned it into a focus of mighty battles. 
A new life hurried and rattled over its unevenly paved 
streets and clattered against the little windows where 
anxious faces were on the watch. Foreigners drank 
the treasured cellars dry, flung themselves on the great 
mahogany beds, and upset the contemplative civilians 
with something fresh every day. Now in their changed 
surroundings they could do no more than collect at 
comers or in doorways and hold whispered consulta¬ 
tions over the latest fairy-tales of an eye-witness and the 
most certain news of the final and speedy victory of 
their fellow-countrymen. 

The men lived in barracks and the officers in the Rue

des Liniers. While we were there this street had the 
appearance of a students* quarter. Conversation 
carried on from one window to another, nightly sing¬ 
songs, and little romantic adventures were the order 
of the day. 

We went every morning for training to the great 
square near the village of Fontaine, which was later to 
become famous. My job was a very interesting one, 
for Colonel von Oppen had entrusted me with the 
training of the storm troop. 

My billet was extremely comfortable. It was in the 
house of a jeweller named Plancot-Bourlon, and he 
and his wife were both very friendly. They seldom 
allowed my mid-day meal to pass without sending me 
up something good from their own table. At night we 
drank tea together, played cards, and talked. One of the 
questions we most often discussed, naturally enough, 
was the very difficult one, why there had to be wars. 

On these occasions M. Plancot used to tell stories of 
the citizens of Cambrai, who are never too busy for a 
joke. In peace time these stories had sent streets, 
wineshops, and market into roars of laughter, and they 
reminded me very forcibly of Tillier’s wonderful uncle 
Benjamin. 

A wicked fellow once sent to all the hunchbacks of 
the district requesting them to call on a certain solicitor 
with reference to an important inheritance. At the 
appointed hour he and some of his friends watched 
from the window of the opposite house and enjoyed the 
delightful comedy—seventeen outraged and weeping 
hobgoblins storming the office of the unfortunate 
lawyer.

There was the story, too, of an old spinster who lived 
opposite, and who was distinguished by a long and 
slender neck strangely bent to one side. Twenty years 
before she had been notoriously eager to marry. Six 
young fellows presented themselves, and to each she 
gladly gave the permission to speak to her parents. 
The next Sunday a capacious coach drove up in which 
sat the six young men, each with a bouquet in his hand. 
In terror she locked the door and hid herself, and the 
suitors delighted the neighbourhood by playing the 
fool in the street. 

Again : A notorious young Cambresian went to the 
market and asked a peasant’s wife, pointing to a soft, 
round, and appetizing cheese covered with green mould: 

4 What is the price of this cheese ? ’ 

4 Twenty sous, sir.’ 

He paid her the twenty sous. 

4 So the cheese is now mine ? ’ 

4 To be sure, sir.’ 

4 And can I do what I like with it ? ’ 

4 Well, of course ! ’ 

Smack 1 he threw the cheese in her face and fled. 

On the 25th of July we left the dear little town and 
entrained for Flanders. We had read in the papers 
that an artillery duel was raging there such as the world 
had never seen. 

We detrained in Staden to the distant thunder of guns 
and marched through the unfamiliar landscape to our 
camp. On either side of the dead-straight road 
were green and fruitful fields, raised up in plots like 
flower-beds, and luscious, well-watered meadows sur¬ 
rounded by hedges. There were clean farmhouses 



LANGEMARCK 


164 

scatteredhere and there, with lowthatched ortiledroofs, 
and on the walls bundles of tobacco-plants hung out to 
dry. The countryfolk on the roads were of German 
type, and their rough speech had a pleasant, homely 
sound. We spent the afternoon in the farm gardens 
to avoid being seen from the air. Now and then the 
shells of heavy naval guns could be heard rushing 
hoarsely overhead from far back and then exploding 
not far from us. A number of men of the 91st Regi¬ 
ment who were bathing in one of the numerous little 
streams were killed. 

Towards evening I had to go with an advance de¬ 
tachment to the front line to prepare for the relief, 
and we went through Houthulst Forest and the village 
of Koekuit to the reserve battalion. On the way we 
had to ‘ break step 9 once or twice on account of some 
heavy shells. In the darkness I heard the voice of a 
recruit: * The officer never lies down ! * 

‘ He knows what he is about/ an older soldier in¬ 
formed him. ‘ Wait till a proper one comes, and he *11 
be the first to lie down ! ' 

The man had noticed the principle I always followed: 

1 Only take cover when it is necessary, and then do it 
quickly/ 

It is true that only the experienced can judge of the 
necessity, and feel the end of the sheirs trajectory 
before the recruit has even recognized the light warn¬ 
ing whisper in the air. 

Our guides, who did not seem to be quite sure of 
themselves, took us along an endless box-trench. 
Such is the name for trenches that are not dug in the 
ground, because the water would stand in them at 




LANGEMARCK 


i6 5 

once, but built up above its level with sandbags and 
fascines. Then we went along the side of a terribly 
dishevelled wood, from which a few days before, 
according to our guides, a regimental staff had been 
driven by the small matter of one thousand 24-centi¬ 
metre shells. ‘ Things seem to be done on a large 
scale here,’ I thought to myself. 

After we had wandered backwards and forwards 
through thick undergrowth, we came to a halt in a 
piece of ground overgrown with weeds and fringed 
by a marshy swamp in whose black pools the moon¬ 
light was reflected. Our guide had abandoned us, and 
all the while shells were falling somewhere and sling¬ 
ing up the mud that splashed back again into the water. 
At last the miserable guide returned to receive the full 
volley of our wrath and to announce that he had found 
the way. Nevertheless, he again led us astray till we 
came at last to a dressing-station over which shrapnel 
shells were bursting in couples at short and regular 
intervals. The bullets and empty cases rattled through 
the branches. The M.O. on duty gave us a sensible 
fellow, who took us on to the Mauseburg, the head¬ 
quarters of the reserve line. 

From there I went straight on to the company of the 
225th Regiment that our 2nd Company was to relieve. 
It took me a long search in the shell-pitted country 
before I found a few ruinous houses that were fortified 
inside by reinforced concrete. One had been smashed 
in the day before by a shell and the occupants squashed 
like mice beneath the falling roof-plate. 

I spent the rest of the night in the company com¬ 
mander’s overcrowded concrete block-house. He was 



i66 


LANGEMARCK 


an honest front-line swine who, with his orderlies, was 
passing the time over a bottle of schnaps and a good 
chunk of pork, with frequent intervals during which 
he listened to the steadily increasing shell-fire and 
shook his head. Then he would fall to bemoaning 
the good old days on the Russian front, and cursing 
the way his regiment had been pumped out. At last 
I fell asleep. 

My sleep was heavy and oppressed. The H.E. 
shells falling all round the house in the pitchy darkness 
evoked a sense of indescribable loneliness and forlorn¬ 
ness from the murdered landscape. Involuntarily I 
nestled up to a man who shared the same bunk. Once 
I was scared by a heavy thump. My men made a light 
and looked to see if the wall had been penetrated. It 
was found that a light shell had exploded against the 
outer wall. 

I spent the next afternoon with the commanding 
officer of the battalion at the Mauseburg, as there were 
still some important points on which I had to be in¬ 
formed. All the time 15-centimetre shells were falling 
round headquarters, while the captain, with his adju¬ 
tant and the orderly officer, played an endless game of 
Skat over a sodawater bottle full of raw spirits. Some¬ 
times he put his cards down to send off a report, or to 
discuss very seriously whether our concrete shelter 
was bomb-proof. We convinced him, in spite of the 
warmth with which he argued the contrary (the wish 
being clearly the father to the thought), that we were 
not fitted to sustain a direct hit from the air. 

In the evening the customary artillery fire rose to 
frantic intensity, and in the front line there was an 



LANGEMARCK 


167 

unceasing display of coloured lights. Dust-covered 
despatch-carriers brought in reports that the enemy 
was attacking. After weeks of drum-fire the infantry 
battle had begun. 

I went back to company headquarters, and waited 
there for the arrival of the 2nd Company. It appeared 
at four in the morning during a very lively burst of 
shell-fire. I took command of my platoon at once 
and led it to a position covered with the fragments of 
a shell-destroyed house, a spot most unspeakably for¬ 
lorn in the midst of an immense and dreary waste of 
shell-holes. 

At six in the morning the Flanders mist lifted and 
gave us a glimpse of our ghastly surroundings. At 
once a swarm of low-flying enemy machines appeared, 
scrutinizing the battered ground and sounding sirens. 
Any scattered detachments of infantry that were above 
ground instantly endeavoured to hide themselves in 
shell-holes. 

Half an hour later a terrific artillery fire set in. It 
raged round our refuge like a typhoon-scourged sea 
round an island. The hail of shells thickened to a 
throbbing wall of fire. We crouched together, expect¬ 
ing each second the crashing hit that would sweep us 
up with our concrete blocks and make our position 
indistinguishable from the desert of craters all round. 

The whole day passed in bursts of heavy shell-fire 
like this, with pauses during which we prepared our¬ 
selves for the next bout. 

In the evening an exhausted orderly turned up and 
handed me an order. From this I learned that the 
xst, 3rd, and 4th Companies were to counter-attack at 



168 


LANGEMARCK 


10.30, and that the 2nd Company after being relieved 
was to swarm into the front line. In order to get a 
little strength to face the hours ahead, I lay down, 
never dreaming that my brother Fritz, whom I sup¬ 
posed to be still in Hanover, was in a section of the 
3rd Company, and passing close to my hut in a hurri¬ 
cane of fire on his way to the attack. 

My sleep was disturbed for a long while by the piti¬ 
ful cries of a wounded man whom two Saxons had 
brought in. They had lost their way, and were utterly 
done up and had fallen asleep. When they woke in 
the morning, their comrade was dead. They carried 
him to the nearest shell-hole, and after covering him 
with a few shovelfuls of earth they went on their way, 
leaving one more to be added to the countless lonely 
and unknown graves of the war. 

I woke at eleven out of a heavy sleep. I washed in 
my helmet, and sent for orders to the company com¬ 
mander. To my astonishment, he had already gone, 
without letting me or Kius or our platoons know any¬ 
thing of it. 

This showed the consequence of putting officers of 
another arm of the service in command of front-line 
troops, only because of seniority, and though they 
did not know even how to handle a rifle. Let such 
fetishes be followed when human lives are not at 
stake. 

While I still sat cursing on my bunk and considered 
what to do, an orderly appeared from battalion head¬ 
quarters with the order to take immediate command 
of the 8th Company. 

I learnt that the counter-attack of the 1st Battalion 




LANGEMARCK 


169 

on the previous night had been repulsed with heavy 
loss, and that what was left had taken up a defensive 
position in a small wood called Dobschiitz wood, and 
to right and left of it. The 8th Company had been 
given the task of swarming into the wood in support. 
It had, however, run into a barrage in the intervening 
ground and suffered heavy losses. As the company 
commander, Lieutenant Budingen, was among the 
fallen, I was to lead the company on in a fresh 
advance. 

After I had taken leave of my orphaned platoon, I 
made my way with the orderly across country. The 
desolation lay under a rain of shrapnel, and as we went 
along half-bent we were checked by a despairing voice. 
In the distance we could see a figure with bleeding 
arm-stumps raising itself from a shell-hole. We 
pointed to the hut we had just left, and hastened on. 

I found the 8th Company crouching behind a row 
of concrete positions : an utterly dispirited little mob. 

* Platoon commanders ! ’ 

Three N.C.Os. came forward and declared that a 
further advance towards Dobschiitz wood was out 
of the question. It was indeed the fact that the 
shells were bursting on our front like a wall of fire. 
Next I had the platoons assembled behind three con¬ 
crete positions. Each was about fifteen to twenty men 
strong. At this moment the fire lifted and came on 
to us. The scene was indescribable. At the concrete 
position on the left a whole section was blown into 
the air ; the right got a direct hit and buried Lieutenant 
Budingen, who was still lying there wounded, beneath 
its tons of masonry. We were in a mortar and beaten 



170 


LANGEMARCK 


down by incessant concussions. Faces as white as 
death stared at one another, and the cries of those who 
were hit never ceased. 

It was all the same now whether we stayed where 
we were, or went on or back. So I gave the command 
to follow me, and sprang out into the fire. After a 
few steps I was covered with earth and flung into a 
shell-hole by a shell which fortunately exploded straight 
upwards. I observed soon after, however, that the 
fire was not so heavy further on. When I had worked 
my way forward another two hundred metres, I looked 
about me. There was not a soul in sight. 

Finally, two men emerged from the clouds of dust 
and smoke. Then one more. Then another two. 
With these five men I safely arrived at my goal. 

I found Lieutenant Sandvoss, commander of the 
3rd Company, and little Schultz seated in a half- 
smashed - up concrete pill - box with three heavy 
machine-guns. I was greeted with a loud 4 Hullo ! * 
and a sip of cognac; and then the situation, by no 
means a pleasant one, was explained to me. The 
English were close in front of us, and both our flanks 
were in the air. We cordially agreed that this was a 
corner too tight for any but old veterans who had 
grown grey in the smoke of battle. 

Without a word of warning Sandvoss asked me if 
I had heard anything of my brother. My feelings 
can be imagined when I heard that he had been in 
yesterday’s attack and was missing. A moment later 
a man came and told me that my brother was lying 
wounded in a shelter close by, and pointed out to me 
a desolate blockhouse covered with uprooted trees. 




LANGEMARCK 


171 

I hurried across a clearing which was covered by rifle- 
fire, and went in. What a meeting ! My brother lay 
among a crowd of groaning stretcher-cases in a place 
that stank of death. He was in a sad plight. He had 
been hit by two shrapnel bullets in the attack, one of 
which had pierced the lung and the other his right 
shoulder. Fever shone in his eyes ; it was only with 
difficulty that he could move or speak or breathe. He 
returned the pressure of my hand, and we began 
to talk. 

It was clear to me that I could not leave him there, 
for at any moment the English might attack, or a shell 
put an end to the already damaged concrete shelter. It 
was a brother’s duty to get him sent back at once. In 
spite of Sandvoss, who would not hear of any weaken¬ 
ing of our strength, I ordered the five men who had 
come with me to get my brother back to the Kolum- 
busei dressing-station, and from there to bring back 
with them men to rescue the other wounded also. 
We tied him in a ground-sheet, and stuck a long pole 
through it, which rested on two of the men’s shoulders. 
I squeezed his hand again, and the sad procession 
started on its way. 

From the edge of the wood I watched the swaying 
load on its way through another wood, among towering 
shell-bursts. As each one struck, I caught myself 
together, though the place where I was was no safer. 
It is odd that another’s danger makes a stronger im¬ 
pression than one’s own. This may be explained 
partly by the confidence in his own luck that every one 
has. The belief that nothing can happen to himself 
makes each man underestimate the danger. It is only 



172 


LANGEMARCK 


in another’s case that one sees how overwhelming it 
is and how defenceless its victim. 

After I had skirmished a little from the shell-holes 
on the forward edge of the wood with the English, 
who were coming on very slowly, I spent the night 
with my men and a machine-gun section among 
the ruins of the concrete pill-box. H.E. shells of 
quite extraordinary ferocity were going up all the 
time close by us. In the evening I was within an 
ace of being killed by one of them. The machine- 
gun began rattling off towards morning, when some 
figures approached in the darkness. It was a patrol 
of the 76th Regiment, come to get into touch with 
us. One of them was killed. There were many 
such mistakes during these days, but it was of no use 
to dwell on them. 

At six in the morning we were relieved by a detach¬ 
ment from the 9th Company. They brought me 
orders to occupy the Rattenburg with my men. I had 
a casualty on the way, a Fahnenjunker wounded by a 
shrapnel bullet. 

We found the Rattenburg to be a shell-shot house 
walled up with concrete slabs. It stood close by the 
marshy bed of the Steenbeek, which no doubt well 
deserved its name. 

Somewhat done up, we entered into possession and 
flung ourselves down on the straw-covered bed boards. 
After a good feed and a pipe of tobacco we felt more 
ourselves again. 

In the early hours of the afternoon we were heavily 
shelled with shells up to the heaviest calibres. Be¬ 
tween six and eight one explosion overlapped another, 







LANGEMARCK 


*73 

and the building often trembled at the sickening 
thump of a dud and threatened to collapse. When 
the fire ebbed later on, I went cautiously over a hill 
that was covered in a close and whirring mesh of 
shrapnel to the Kolumbusei dressing - station, and 
asked for news of my brother. The doctor, who 
was examining the terribly mangled legs of a dying 
man, told me to my joy that he had been sent back in 
a fairly promising state. 

Later in the night my ration-party turned up and 
brought the company, now reduced to twenty men, 
warm food, bully-beef, coffee, and bread, tobacco 
and schnaps. We ate heartily, circulating the bottle 
of ‘ 98 per cent.’ without any irksome distinctions of 
rank. Then we turned in ; but our rest, owing to 
the swarms of gnats that rose from the marshy banks 
of the stream, the shells, and the gas that was shot 
over occasionally, was not exactly undisturbed. 

The result was that I was so fast asleep the next 
morning that after a heavy bombardment had gone 
on for hours my men had to rouse me. They told 
me that men were coming back all the time, saying 
that the front line had been evacuated and that the 
enemy were coming on. 

I first followed the old soldier’s maxim, ‘ A good 
breakfast holds body and soul together,’ and then, 
after lighting a pipe, went outside to see what was 
happening. 

I could not see a great deal, as the surroundings were 
veiled in a thick haze. The artillery fire was increas¬ 
ing from moment to moment, and soon reached that 
pitch of intensity which the nerves, incapable of 



LANGEMARCK 


174 

further shock, accept with an almost happy indiffer¬ 
ence. Showers of earth clattered incessantly on the 
roof, and the house itself was hit twice. Incendiary 
shells threw up heavy milk-white clouds, out of 
which fiery drops rained on the ground. A piece of 
this burning stuff came smack on a stone at my feet, 
and went on burning for a good minute. We were 
told later that men hit with it had rolled on the ground 
without being able to put it out. Shells with delay- 
action fuses burrowed into the ground, rumbling and 
pushing out flat disks of soil. Swathes of gas and 
mist crept over the battlefield, hugging the ground. 
Immediately in front we heard rifle and machine-gun 
fire, a sign that the enemy must have advanced 
already. 

Below, beside the stream, I saw some men walking 
through a constantly changing scenery of mud foun¬ 
tains shooting high into the air. I recognized the 
commanding officer, Captain von Brixen, supported 
by two stretcher-bearers, and with an arm bound up. 
I hastened towards him; he called out that the enemy 
was advancing, and warned me not to delay in getting 
under cover. 

Soon the first bullets smacked in the shell-holes near 
by or were shivered against the broken masonry. More 
and more fleeing figures disappeared to our rear, while 
in front a storm of rifle-fire testified to the embittered 
defence put up by those who were holding on. 

It was time to act. I decided to defend the Ratten- 
burg, and made it plain to the men, among whom at 
this there were some rueful faces, that I had not the 
remotest thought of retiring. I posted the men at 



LANGEMARCK 


I 75 

loopholes, and our one machine-gun was mounted on a 
window-sill. A shell-hole was chosen and a stretcher- 
bearer, who soon had plenty to do, was installed there. 
I, too, took a rifle I found lying about, and hung a 
belt of cartridges round my neck. 

As my crowd was very small I tried to get reinforce¬ 
ments from the numbers of men who were passing by 
in disorder. Most of them obeyed my call willingly, 
glad to join up, while others whose nerve had gone 
hurried past after a hasty pause to see that there was 
nothing to be got by staying with us. In such cases a 
tender consideration has no place. 

‘ Fire ! ’ I called to the men who stood in front of me 
in the cover of the house, and a few shots rang out. 
Overcome by the eloquence of the rifle-muzzle, the 
shirkers, of whom in every battle there must always be 
some, came slowly nearer, though it was plain from 
their faces how little eager they were to give us their 
company. A canteen orderly whom I knew well made 
all kinds of excuses to get away. But I would not let 
go of him. 

4 But I have no rifle ! ’ 

4 Then wait till there’s a man shot.’ 

During a final crisis of artillery fire, in the course of 
which the ruins of the house were hit several times and 
the fragments of bricks pattered down on our helmets 
from high in the air, I was thrown down to the ground 
in the flash of a terrific burst. To the astonishment of 
the men, I got up again unhurt. 

After this wild whirligig of shells it became calmer. 
The fire lifted over us and rested on the Langemarck- 
Bixschoote road. But we were none the better off in 



LANGEMARCK 


176 

mind, for so far we had not seen the wood for trees ; 
the danger had been so overwhelming that we had had 
no time or power to think of it. Now that the storm 
had swept on past us, every one had time to get ready 
for what was inevitably coming nearer. And it came. 

The rifles in front were silent. The opposition 
had been overcome. Out of the haze emerged a 
thick advancing line. My men fired crouching behind 
the wreckage. The machine-gun tacked out. As 
though they had been wiped away, the attacking line 
vanished into shell-holes and opened fire on us. Strong 
detachments went on to the left and right. We were 
soon surrounded by a ring of fire. 

The position was pointless, and there was no object 
in sacrificing the men. I gave the order to retire. 
Now that they had started, it was difficult to make the 
men give up the fight. 

Making use of a low-lying cloud of smoke, we got 
away unobserved, partly by wading above the hips 
along the stream. I was the last to leave the little fort. 
Lieutenant Hohlemann, whom I helped along, was 
bleeding from a severe head-wound, though he joked 
and made light of it as we went. 

As we crossed the road we ran into the 2nd Company, 
who had been sent up in support. After a brief con¬ 
sultation we decided to stay where we were and await 
the enemy. Here, too, we had to compel troops of 
other units, who wished to carry out retirements on 
their own, to remain. Stern measures were necessary 
to persuade artillerymen, and signallers, and so on, that 
even they in circumstances like these had to take hold 
of a rifle and get into the firing-line. With the help of 



LANGEMARCK 


177 


Kius and a few quiet folk I soon got matters into order 
by means of entreaties, commands, and blows with 
the butt-end. 

Then we sat ourselves in a half-dug trench and had 
breakfast. Kius pulled out his inevitable camera and 
took photographs. On our left there was some move¬ 
ment on the outskirts of Langemarck. The men began 
shooting at some figures that were running here and 
there, until I told them to stop. Immediately after a 
N.C.O. came up and reported that a company of the 
Fusilier Guards were taking up a position on the road, 
and that our fire had inflicted losses. 

I gave the order thereupon to advance and occupy 
the highest part of the road. There was lively rifle- 
fire, some of the men fell, and Lieutenant Bartmer 
of the 2nd Company was severely wounded. Kius 
remained at my side and finished his piece of bread-and- 
butter as we went. When we occupied the line of the 
road, whence the ground fell away to the Steenbeek, 
we saw that the English had been on the point of doing 
the same. The first khaki uniforms were already 
within twenty metres of it. As far as the eye could see, 
the ground to our front was full of troops in line 
and column. They were swarming round the Ratten- 
burg too. 

We made full use of the surprise of our sudden 
appearance and at once opened a steady fire on them. 
Along the Steenbeek a whole column broke up. One 
man had a coil of wire on his back of which he was 
unrolling one end. Others jumped like hares this way 
and that while our bullets raised clouds of dust among 
them. A sturdy corporal of the 8th Company rested 

M 



LANGEMARCK 


178 

his rifle with the greatest calm on a shattered tree- 
stump and shot four of the enemy one after the 
other. The remainder crept into shell-holes and lay 
concealed there till nightfall. We had made a 
good clearance. 

At about 11 o’clock aeroplanes tied with streamers 
came diving down on us and were driven off by 
a lively fire, which they replied to from above. In 
the midst of the wild clatter I could not help smiling 
when a man reported to me and desired to have it 
placed on record that he had shot down a machine in 
flames with his rifle. 

Immediately after occupying the road I had made 
a report to regimental headquarters and asked for re¬ 
inforcements. At mid-day detachments of infantry, 
engineers, and machine-guns came up in support. 
According to the time-honoured tactics of Old Fritz all 
of them were crammed into the already crowded front¬ 
line. Here and there the English laid out a few of the 
men who incautiously crossed the road. 

About 4 o’clock a very unpleasant bombardment 
with shrapnel started. The volleys got the road to a 
T. It was clear to me that the aeroplanes had ascer¬ 
tained the line on which we were making a stand, and 
that there were worse times ahead. 

And, in fact, we were soon being heavily shelled with 
shells of all sizes. We lay close to one another in the 
narrow and crowded ditch of the road. Fire danced 
before our eyes ; twigs and clods whistled about our 
ears. Close to me on my left a flash flared out, leaving 
a white suffocating vapour behind it. I crept on all- 
fours to the man next me. He moved no more. The

blood trickled from many wounds caused by small 
jagged splinters. On my right, too, there were 
many hit. 

After half an hour it was quiet and we set to digging 
out the shallow trough of the ditch so as to have at least 
protection from splinters in case of a second bombard¬ 
ment. Our entrenching tools came against rifles, 
equipment, and cartridge-cases of 1914, showing that 
this soil was not drinking blood for the first time. 

As dark came on we were given another thorough 
good do. I crouched beside Kius in a little hole that 
had cost us some blisters. The ground rocked like a 
ship’s deck under hit after hit at the least possible 
distances. We were ready for the end. 

I chewed my pipe, my helmet pressed on to my fore¬ 
head, and stared at the pa v 6 whose stones showered 
sparks under the bursting lumps of metal; and I 
succeeded in philosophizing myself into courage. 
The most remarkable thoughts shot through my head. 
I took a trashy French novel, Le Vautour de la Sierra, 
that I had picked up at Cambrai, into lively considera¬ 
tion. I repeated several times to myself a saying of 
Ariosto, * A great heart cares nothing for death when it 
comes, so long as it be glorious.’ It may seem extra¬ 
ordinary, but it helped me to keep control over myself. 
When the shells gave our ears a little peace, I heard 
fragments of the beautiful song from The Black Whale of 
Askelon close beside me, and I thought that my friend 
Kius must have had a drop too much. Every one has 
his own manner of calming his nerves. 

At the end of it a large splinter struck my hand. 
Kius took out a torch. We found only a scratch.

i So 

Hours such as these were without doubt the most 
awful of the whole war. 

You cower in a heap alone in a hole and feel yourself 
the victim of a pitiless thirst for destruction. With 
horror you feel that all your intelligence, your capaci¬ 
ties, your bodily and spiritual characteristics, have 
become utterly meaningless and absurd. While you 
think it, the lump of metal that will crush you to a 
shapeless nothing may have started on its course. 
Your discomfort is concentrated in your ear, that tries 
to distinguish amid the uproar the swirl of your own 
death rushing near. It is dark, too; and you must 
find in yourself alone all the strength for holding out. 
You can't get up and with a blase laugh light a cigarette 
in the wondering sight of your companions. Nor can 
you be encouraged by the sight of your friend clipping 
a monocle into his eye to observe a hit on the traverse 
close beside you. You know that not even a cock will 
crow when you are hit. 

Well, why don't you jump up and rush into the night 
till you collapse in safety behind a bush like an ex¬ 
hausted animal ? Why do you hang on there all the 
time, you and your braves ? There are no superior 
officers to see you. 

Yet some one watches you. Unknown perhaps to 
yourself, there is some one within you who keeps you 
to your post by the power of two mighty spells : Duty 
and Honour. You know that this is your place in the 
battle, and that a whole people relies on you to do your 
job. You feel, * If I leave my post, I am a coward in 
my own eyes, a wretch who will ever after blush at every 
word of praise.' You clench your teeth and stay. 



LANGEMARCK 


181 

All of us held on that evening, all who lay along that 
dark Flanders road. Officers and men alike showed 
what they were made of. Duty and Honour must be 
the corner-stones of every army. And a heightened 
sense of duty and honour must be inculcated in the 
officer who fights in the forefront of the battle. For 
that, suitable material and a fixed mould are required. 
The truth of this is fully known only in war. . . . 

It began to drizzle after midnight; patrols of a regi¬ 
ment which had come up meanwhile in support went 
forward as far as the Steenbeek and found nothing but 
mud-filled shell-holes. The enemy had withdrawn 
beyond the stream. 

Worn out by the fatigues of this tremendous day, we 
got down into our holes, with the exception of the men 
on guard. I pulled the cloak of my dead neighbour 
over my head and fell into a restless sleep. As it grew 
light I was awakened by a curiously cold feeling and 
discovered that I was in a sad way. It was raining in 
torrents and the drainage of the road was pouring into 
the hole where I was sitting. I built a small dam and 
bailed out my resting-place with a saucepan-lid. In 
consequence of the ever-increasing volume of water I 
had to add one course after another to my earthwork, 
till at last faulty construction yielded to growing weight 
and a muddy stream gurgled in and filled my refuge to 
the brim. While I was busy fishing out my revolver 
and helmet, tobacco and rations were borne away along 
the ditch, whose other occupants were faring just as 
I was. We stood shivering with cold and without a 
dry stitch on our bodies, knowing that when next we 
were shelled we had no protection whatever. It was a 



i iz 


LANGEMARCK 


cheerful situation. And here I permit myself the 
observation that even artillery fire does not break the 
resistance of troops so surely as wet and cold. 

The steady downpour was nevertheless a true bless¬ 
ing in its effects upon the further course of the battle ; 
for the English offensive was just in its first and most 
critical days. The enemy had to bring up his artillery 
over a morass of water-logged shell-holes, while we had 
undamaged roads for the transport of all we needed. 

At ii in the morning, when we were already des¬ 
perate, an angel appeared in the person of a despatch- 
rider who brought the order for the regiment to 
assemble in Koekuit. 

We saw on the way how difficult communications 
must have been on the day of the attack. The roads 
were packed with men and horses. Twelve horribly 
mutilated horses lay in one heap near some limbers 
whose wreckage was scarcely recognizable. 

What was left of the regiment assembled in a rain- 
soaked meadow over which single bursts of shrapnel 
opened their white balls. It was a shock to see what 
was left—a body of about the strength of a company 
with a small group of officers in the midst. What 
losses ! Of two battalions, nearly all the officers and 
men ! The survivors stood in pouring rain with 
gloomy faces till quarters were assigned. Then we 
dried ourselves in a wooden hut, crowding round a 
glowing stove, and got fresh courage from a hearty 
meal. Human nature is indeed indestructible. 

Towards evening shells fell in the village. One of 
the huts was hit and several men of the 3rd Company 
killed. In spite of the shelling we soon lay down to 



LANGEMARCK 


183 

sleep, only hoping that we should not have to counter¬ 
attack in the rain or be flung without warning into some 
gap in the line. 

At 3 in the morning orders came that we were 
definitely to be taken out of the line. We marched 
along the pav6 to Staden. It was strewn all the way 
with dead bodies and smashed-up transport. Twelve 
dead lay round the crater of one gigantic burst alone. 
Staden, that had been so full of life on our arrival, now 
had many houses shelled ; the deserted market-place 
heaped up with household goods hurriedly taken out 
of the houses. One family was leaving the town at the 
same time as we were. It led a cow as its only posses¬ 
sion. The man had a wooden leg, and the woman led 
the crying children by the hand. The confused din 
behind added to the sadness of the picture. 

The remains of the 2nd Battalion were quartered in 
a lonely farm, concealed behind tall hedges in the midst 
of luxuriant fields. There I was given command of 
the 7th Company. Till the end of the war its fortune 
and mine were one. 

In the evening we sat before an old tiled hearth 
and refreshed ourselves with a stiff grog while we 
listened to the thunder of battle breaking out afresh. 
A sentence from the army communique suddenly met 
my eyes in a recent newspaper : * We succeeded in 
holding up the attack on the Steenbeek.* 

It was odd to feel that our apparently confused 
doings in the depth of night had won a place in history. 
The enemy offensive, launched with such tremendous 
force, had been brought to a standstill, and we had 
had a large share in that result. 



LANGEMARCK 


184 

Soon we turned in in the hayloft. In spite of the 
profound sleep in which they were sunk, most of the 
sleepers tossed to and fro in their dreams, as though 
they had to fight their Flanders battle over again. 

On the 3rd of August we set off on the march to 
the station of the neighbouring town of Gits. We 
took much of the cattle and produce of the now 
deserted neighbourhood with us. The whole battalion, 
in fine spirits again, shrunken though it was, had 
coffee in the station restaurant. Two buxom Flemish 
waitresses added to its flavour and to the general 
contentment by their bold speeches. The men were 
particularly delighted when they addressed every one, 
officers included, as 4 thou/ as it is the local custom 
to do. 

* * 

A few days later I had a letter from my brother in 
hospital in Gelsenkirchen. He wrote that he was 
booked for a stiff arm and a shaky lung. 

I take the following pages from his diary. They 
fill in my own account and give a vivid picture of the 
impressions made on a young boy who was thrown 
into the hurricane of modern battle :— 

* “ . . . Fall in for the attack ! ” The face of my 
platoon commander, Sergeant-major Schnell, looked 
in over the entrance of the little hole covered with 
branches and boards where we had lain for hours 
smoking and eating. The three men near me stopped 
their talk and jumped up cursing. I got up and put 
on my equipment, set my helmet tight on my head, 
and went out into the dusk. It was misty and chilly. 



LANGEMARCK 


i*S 

The scene had altered meanwhile. The shell-fire had 
moved off and now thundered on other parts of the 
immense battlefield. Aeroplanes roared through the 
air and calmed one’s anxiously peering eyes with their 
large iron crosses. 

‘ I went once more to a spring which was still 
wonderfully clear in spite of the wreckage and rubbish, 
and drawing up the bucket I drank, and filled my water- 
bottle. 

4 The company fell in by platoons. I quickly stuck 
four bombs in my belt and went to my section, from 
which two men were missing. I had scarcely time to 
write down their names before we moved off. The 
platoons proceeded in single file over the shell-holes, 
skirting bits of timber, squeezing against hedges, 
sinking into holes, and making their way with much 
clatter and rattle to attack the enemy. 

4 I knew what my task was. The 2nd Battalion of 
our regiment and a battalion of another on our flank 
had orders to drive some English detachments, which 
had pushed on over the canal, back to the other side 
again. My orders were to take up a position in advance 
with my section and to lie down in readiness to open 
the counter-attack. While I was going over this 
again, I happened to see the pale, set face of a young 
N.C.O. 44 Bachmann,” I thought, although I did not 
know him. It was my comrade, a Fahnenjunker like¬ 
wise in Sandvoss’s company. I lost sight of him, 
and looked with astonishment at the scene that had 
suddenly unfolded. 

4 The remains of a large wood, black, branchless, 
and splintered stumps, stuck up in isolation here and 



186 


LANGEMARCK 


there from the scarred Flanders plain. Immense 
swathes of smoke drifted through the air and hung 
the sky with a gloomy, heavy pall. Stinking gases, 
yellow and brown, hung and swayed heavily to and fro 
over the earth that the shells tore up so mercilessly 
again and again. 

‘ The order was given to be ready for gas. At this 
moment a terrific fire came on us like a fit. The 
soil flew up in fountains and a hail of splinters swept 
the ground like a shower of rain. For a moment every 
one stood dazed. Then all broke away like mad. I 
heard our commanding officer, Captain Bockelmann, 
bellowing out something, but I could understand 
nothing. 

‘ My men had vanished and I found myself in 
another platoon. I pressed on with the rest to the 
wreckage of a village that the shells had razed relent¬ 
lessly to the very foundations. We pulled out our 
masks. 

* Without a moment’s warning we were in a terrific 
machine-gun barrage. Every one threw himself down. 
Near me on my left Lieutenant Ehlers was kneeling 
up, and near him lay a N.C.O. keeping a look-out. 
In front there was a yellow, flashing wall of fire. Burst 
followed burst. Fragments of masonry, showers of 
soil, brickbats, and splinters rained down on us and 
struck sparks from our helmets. I stared into this 
glaring witch’s cauldron. 

‘ Compared to this, what was the half-hour’s drum¬ 
fire that had prepared for this ill-fated attack ? For it 
was as clear to me as a vision that it had failed. Thrice 
at short intervals a tremendous crash swept through 



LANGEMARCK 


187 

the uproar. Whole rubbish-heaps took the air at once, 
whirled around and pelted down again with hellish 
clatter. 

* I looked to my right. Ehlers was shouting some¬ 
thing. He raised his left hand, beckoned over his 
shoulder, and with a shout sprang forward. I got up 
heavily and followed at the double. My feet were 
burning like fire after the night before, but my socks 
had soaked up the blood and the pain was not so 
sharp. 

* I had not gone twenty steps when the flash of a 
shrapnel blinded me as I struggled up out of a shell- 
hole. It burst not ten paces in front of me at a height 
of three metres. I felt two dull blows against my chest 
and shoulder. My rifle flew from my hands of its 
own accord and I fell backwards into the shell-hole. 
I could still hear remotely Ehlers shouting as he went 
by, “ It’s finished him.” He was not to live out 
another day. The attack miscarried, and in jumping 
back he was killed and all who were with him. A shot 
through the back of the head ended the life of this 
gallant officer. 

‘ When I woke from a long fainting fit all was still. 
I tried to stand up, but I felt a sharp pain in my right 
shoulder that increased with every movement. My 
breath was short and gasping. The lung could not 
get enough air. “ Hit through lung and shoulder,” 
I thought, and threw away pack and belt and, in a 
mood of utter apathy, gas-mask too, and hung my 
water-bottle on the hooks of my tunic. 

‘ After five steps I sank helplessly into a neighbour¬ 
ing shell-hole. After an hour, perhaps, I made a second 



188 


LANGEMARCK 


attempt to crawl on, as a light drum-fire had started. 
This attempt, too, miscarried. I lost my water-bottle 
and sank into a state of exhaustion, from which after 
a long time the sensation of burning thirst aroused 
me. 

4 It began to rain gently. I succeeded in collecting 
a few muddy drops in my steel helmet. I had lost all 
sense of direction. There was a thunderstorm, but 
its peals were lost in a new onset of drum-fire. I clung 
close to the side of the shell-hole. A clod struck my 
shoulder. Heavy splinters swept over my head. 
Gradually I lost all sense of time. 

‘ Once two men appeared, hurrying by with long 
strides. I called to them, but they disappeared in the 
mist like shadows without hearing me. At last three 
men came straight towards me. I recognized the 
middle one as the N.C.O. of the day before. They 
took me to a little hut near by. It was crammed with 
wounded, whom two orderlies were seeing to. I had 
lain thirteen hours among the shell-holes. 

‘ In a corner I saw Bachmann, who convulsively 
clasped his shattered knee and swallowed down his 
agony. We spoke in fragments. Now and then when 
any one pushed against him he suppressed a groan. 

1 All the while the artillery fire kept at the same 
pitch. Shell after shell burst close to us, often covering 
the roof with sand and earth. My wounds were 
dressed, and I was given a new mask and a piece of 
bread spread with coarse red jam, and a little water. 
The orderly looked after us like a father. 

* The English began to push forward. They came 
on by springs and then disappeared in shell-holes, as 



LANGEMARCK 189 

I could make out from the cries of consternation 
outside. 

* Then my company commander, Lieutenant Sand- 
voss, came in. He asked me if I could walk, and then 
was called away by an orderly and vanished. Imme¬ 
diately I heard him giving orders. A machine-gun 
was mounted and began to tack out. 

‘ Suddenly a young officer smeared in mud from his 
boots to his helmet, with the Iron Cross of the 1st 
class on his breast, rushed in. It was my brother, who 
days before, down the line, was said to be dead. We 
greeted each other, smiling rather awkwardly in the 
stress of our feelings. After a minute or two he left 
me and came back with the last five men of his com¬ 
pany. I was put in a ground-sheet and carried from 
the battlefield to the thunder of guns.’ 



REGNlfiVILLE 


O N the 4th of July 1917 we got out of the train 
(at the famous Mars-la-Tour. The 7th and 
8th Companies were quartered in Doncourt, 
where for some days we lived an almost contemplative 
life. The only source of conflict for me was the short¬ 
age of rations. It was strictly forbidden to forage in 
the fields, and yet the military police brought me 
reports nearly every morning with the names of men 
whom they had caught potato-lifting by night. I 
had to punish them, for the crime of being caught, 
as it stood in my (perhaps unofficial) code. 

I had to learn, too, during those days that wrong¬ 
doing never comes to any good. Tebbe and I had 
brought with us a princely lord-mayor’s coach from 
an abandoned Flemish mansion, and had contrived 
to include it in the transport unobserved. Now we 
planned a magnificent expedition to Metz, in order to 
taste life at the full once more. So we harnessed 
up one afternoon and drove off. Unfortunately, the 
coach had no brakes, since it was designed for the 
Flemish plain, not for the hills of Lorraine. Before 
we were out of the village we had already begun to 
roll, and soon found ourselves embarked on a mad 
career that boded no good. The first to jump for it 
was the coachman ; then Tebbe, who fell full-length 
on a heap of agricultural implements, and lay there. 
I remained alone on the silken upholstery, but certainly 
not at my ease. A door flew open, and was knocked 

190 



REGNlfiVILLE 


*9* 


straight off by a telegraph pole. Finally, the coach 
leapt down a bank and crashed against the wall of a 
house. I left the wreckage by a window, and ascer¬ 
tained that, with my usual luck, I was none the worse. 

On the 9th the company was inspected by the com¬ 
mander of the division, Major-General von Busse, 
who praised us for our conduct in the recent fighting. 
We entrained on the next afternoon for the neighbour¬ 
hood of Thiaucourt. Thence we marched straight 
on to our new position in the line. It lay along the 
wooded heights of the C6te Lorraine, opposite the 
much-shelled village of Regni6ville, so often mentioned 
in the orders of the day. I inspected my front the 
first morning. It struck me as being of very generous 
length for one company, and it consisted of a maze of 
trenches half fallen in, and by no means easy to take 
stock of. Besides all this, the front line had been 
flattened out in many places by a species of heavy 
mortar bomb commonly used on this front. My 
dugout was a hundred metres behind in the so-called 
Commerce trench, near the road from Regnidville. 
It was the first time for a long while that we had 
the French opposite us. 

The trench walls were of chalk, and this withstood 
the weather much better than the clay we were accus¬ 
tomed to. In places the sides of the trench were 
even carefully walled, and the floor of it concreted 
for long stretches, so that even in the heaviest rain 
the water could soon run away. The reddish-white 
rock abounded in fossils. Every time I went to my 
dugout with a pocketful of mussels, star-fish, and snake- 
stone. My dugout was deep and drippy. It had a 



192 REGNlSviLLE 

peculiarity very little to my liking, though I am a 
passionate entomologist. Instead of the usual louse, 
we had here its far livelier relative. These two 
varieties appear to have the same enmity to each other 
as the brown and common rat. It was no good adopt¬ 
ing the usual remedy of a change of clothes, for the 
nimble parasites lay in ambush in the straw palliasses. 
At last the victim leapt up in desperation, and could 
have said with Mephisto : 

I give the old rug another shake 
And still one more to flight does take; 

Up ! and away ! with all my soul 
Go find yourselves another ’ole ! 

Rations, too, were very poor. Beyond the thin 
mid-day soup, there was nothing but the third of a 
loaf, and something infinitesimal to eat with it, usually 
half-mouldy jam. Most of mine was always eaten by 
a fat rat, for which I often lay in wait, but in vain. 

This sparse living, which left us always half-fed, 
brought about a most unpleasant state of affairs. The 
men often suffered literally from hunger, and this led 
to pilfering of rations. It surprised me to find that 
I, though used to good and plentiful food, seemed 
to bear the privation much better than the men. 
Cabbage soup was their only thought. When it 
comes to food, the good manners that in Europe are 
mostly whitewash are soon scratched off. A man 
shows his real superiority when hunger is part of the 
meal, not at festive tables. Privation and danger 
tear away all that has been acquired, and then good 
form survives only in those in whom it is born. 



REGNlfiVILLE 193 

The companies in reserve and on rest occupied hut¬ 
ments in picturesque situations deeply hidden in the 
forest. My quarters in reserve were particularly 
delightful. The camp was in a blind comer on the 
edge of a narrow forest gorge. My little hut was 
built half into the bank, and curtained with hazel and 
cornel bushes. From the window I had a view of 
the wooded hillside opposite and a narrow strip of 
meadow traversed by a stream. A collection of 
bottles of all sorts stacked at the back showed that 
many hermits had already spent meditative hours 
there, and I, too, strove to live up to its time-honoured 
associations. When the evening mist rose from below 
and mingled with the heavy white smoke of my wood 
fire, and I squatted in the open door at dusk between 
the warm fire behind and the keen autumn air in front, 
it always seemed to me that only one drink was 
appropriate—red wine and cognac, half-and-half, in 
a big-bellied glass. These intimate communings con¬ 
soled me for the fact that a gentleman from the depot, 
who had seniority over myself, had come to take over 
my company, and that I was once more discharging the 
boring duties of a platoon commander in the trenches. 
I endeavoured to kill the endless hours on trench duty 
by frequent warlike excursions in my old style. 

On the 24th August the gallant Captain Bockelmann 
was wounded by a shell splinter. This made the 
third commanding officer the battalion had lost within 
a short time. On the 29th, with the N.C.O. KIopp- 
mann, the stoutest fellow of the 7th Company, I paid 
a visit to the enemy’s lines. 

We crept up to a gap in the enemy wire, cut by 
N 



194 REGNlEVILLE 

Kloppmann the night before. It was an unpleasant 
surprise to find that it had been mended up again. 
Nevertheless, we cut it through once more, with a 
good deal of noise, and climbed down into the trench. 
We crouched behind the next traverse and listened, 
lying in wait. After a quarter of an hour we went 
cautiously on, following a telegraph wire that came 
to an end at a bayonet stuck in the ground. We found 
the post defended by wire entanglements of all kinds 
and also a trellised door, but unoccupied. After we 
had taken accurate note of everything we went the 
same way back, and carefully connected up the wire 
again across our gap, so as not to betray our visit. 

The next evening Kloppmann again reconnoitred 
the post. However, he was greeted by rifle-fire and 
the lemon-shaped bombs we called * duck’s eggs.’ 
One of them fell close to his head, which was pressed to 
the ground—without exploding. He had to take to his 
heels with all speed. The evening after that there were 
two of us again, and this time we found the front line 
occupied. By listening we accurately located four posts. 
One of them was whistling a very charming tune to him¬ 
self. Finally we were fired on, and crept back. 

When I was standing by myself in the trench again, 
Vogt and Haverkamp suddenly turned up. They had 
very obviously been having a jolly time, and the odd 
idea had come to them of leaving the comfortable 
reserve camp and journeying through a pitch-black 
night to the front line, in order to go, as they said, on 
patrol. I have always made it a rule to let any one 
carry his own skin to market where he pleases ; so I 
made no objection to them clambering out of the 



REGNlfiVILLE 195 

trench, though the enemy still continued in a high 
state of excitement. It is true that the sole purpose 
of their patrol was to look for the silk parachutes of 
French rockets ; and that, having found them, they 
chased each other to and fro in front of the enemy’s 
wire, whirling these white tokens aloft. Naturally, 
they were fired on ; but after a long while they came 
happily back. Bacchus had them in his tender keeping. 

On the 10th September I went from the reserve camp 
to regimental headquarters to ask for leave. * I have 
been thinking of you,’ was Colonel von Oppen’s reply ; 

‘ however, the regiment has to make a raid in force and 
you are to lead it. Look out the best men and get 
them into training down in Souloeuvre camp.’ 

We were to enter the enemy’s trench at two points 
and endeavour to bring prisoners back. The patrol 
was in three parties, two for the attack and one to 
occupy the front line and cover our rear. I led the 
left party, Lieutenant von Kienitz the right. The men 
were all volunteers, and a few who were not required 
nearly wept when I left them out. My party, myself 
included, consisted of fourteen men, and among them 
were the Fahnrich Zglinitzky, the N.C.Os. Klopp- 
mann, Mevius, and Dujesiefken, and two pioneers. 
The most reckless fellows of the 2nd Battalion found 
themselves united. 

We trained ourselves in bomb-throwing for ten days, 
and carried out our enterprise against a carefully-built 
model of the strong-point we were to raid. It was a 
wonder, considering the excessive zeal of the men, that 
I had only two wounded with bomb-splinters before 
the event. For the rest, we were excused all duty; 



REGNlfiVILLE 


196 

so that when on the afternoon of the 22nd September 
we proceeded to the second line, where we were to 
spend the night, I found myself in command of a 
somewhat wild but very useful band. 

In the evening von Kienitz and I made our way 
through the dark forest to regimental headquarters. 
We had been invited to a farewell dinner by the com¬ 
manding officer of the battalion, Captain Schumacher. 
After that we lay down to sleep in our deep dugout. 
It is a peculiar feeling when, knowing that next morning 
you have a fight to the death to go through, you give 
yourself a last audience before you fall asleep. 

We were awakened at three, and we got up and 
washed and had breakfast made for us. I got into a 
temper at once because my batman had over-salted and 
so ruined the poached eggs I had treated myself to, both 
in honour of the day and for my own support. 

We pushed back our plates and went through for 
the hundredth time every detail and contingency. At 
intervals we offered each other cherry-brandies, and 
von Kienitz gave us the benefit of several time- 
honoured jokes. At twenty minutes to five we got 
the men together and led them to the jumping-off 
places in the front line. Gaps in the wire had been 
cut, and long arrows, whitened with lime, pointed to 
our objectives. We separated with a shake of the 
hand and waited for what should come next. 

I was in full array : two sandbags in front of my 
chest, each with four stick bombs, the left-hand one 
having instantaneous, the right-hand with time fuses ; 
in the right-hand pocket of my tunic I had an 08 revolver 
on a long cord; in my right trouser pocket a small 



REGNlfiVILLE 197 

Mauser pistol; in my left tunic pocket five egg bombs; 
in the left trouser pocket a phosphorescent compass 
and a policeman’s whistle; in my belt spring hooks for 
pulling out the bomb pins, a dagger, and wire-cutters. 
There was a pocket-book in my breast pocket and my 
home address, and in the pocket of the back of my 
tunic a flat flask of cherry-brandy. 

We had taken off our shoulder-straps and Gibraltar 
badges so that the enemy should have no information 
as to our unit. We wore a white band round each arm 
so as to know each other. 

Four minutes before five the division on our left 
opened fire as a blind. Exactly at five our artillery 
and trench mortars suddenly opened out. I was 
standing with Kloppmann in front of the dugout 
entrance and smoking a last cigar; we had to take 
cover, however, as many of the shells fell short. Watch 
in hand we counted the minutes. 

Exactly at 5.5 we left the dugouts and made for the 
prepared gaps in our wire. I ran forward, holding a 
bomb aloft, and in the half-light I saw the right-hand 
party rushing on to the attack. 

The enemy wire was poor and I jumped over it in 
two bounds ; but I fell over a trip wire behind it and 
tumbled into a shell-hole. Kloppmann and Mevius 
pulled me out. 

* In ! ’ We jumped into the front line without 
meeting opposition, while from our right came the 
sounds of a bombing engagement. Without worrying 
about that we crossed by the sandbag barricade that 
blocked the next trench, and jumped from shell-hole 
to shell-hole till we came to a double row of ‘ knife-rests ’ 



198 REGNlfiVILLE 

that separated us from the second line. As this trench 
was in a state of confusion and gave no hope of 
prisoners, we hurried on without pausing down a 
communication trench. It was blocked, so I next sent 
the pioneers forward to clear the way, but time being 
short I took the lead myself. 

At the junction of the third line the red glow of a 
cigarette-end fell to the ground in front of me. I gave 
the men a signal, grasped my bomb tighter, and crept 
warily along the well-built trench, against whose walls 
leaned any number of abandoned rifles. At such a 
moment the memory unconsciously fastens upon the 
most trifling objects, and now the sight of a saucepan 
with a spoon in it where the two trenches crossed was 
imprinted on my mind. To this fact I owed my life 
twenty minutes later. 

Suddenly we saw shadowy figures disappear in 
front of us. We ran after them and came to a sand¬ 
bagged sap in whose wall was the mouth of a dugout. 
I went forward and shouted * Montez ! ’ A bomb 
was the only answer. Apparently it was one with 
a time fuse. I heard the little snap and had time 
to jump back. It burst at the height of my head 
against the opposite wall, tore my silken cap, wounded 
my left hand in several places, and tore away the top 
of my little finger. The pioneer sergeant standing 
near me had a hole bored through his nose. We 
retreated a few steps and bombarded the danger-spot 
with bombs. One of us, in an excess of zeal, threw a 
smoke-stick into the entrance and made further attacks 
on it impossible. We turned back then and followed 
the third line in the opposite direction, hoping to get a 



REGNlfiVILLE 


199 

prisoner at last. Arms and equipment had been thrown 
down everywhere. The question, where were the 
owners of all these rifles and where were they lying 
in wait, made a more and more uncomfortable im¬ 
pression on us; but on we hurried all the same, 
undeterred, on and on through the deserted trenches, 
with bombs ready and revolver outstretched. 

It was only by thinking it out later that I made 
out our course after this. We had turned without 
noticing into a third communication trench and by 
this time were well into the middle of our own barrage, 
and approaching the fourth line. Here and there we 
pulled open the boxes of bombs built into the sides 
of the trench and stuck a bomb in our pockets as a 
keepsake. 

After we had gone to and fro and up and down 
trenches running parallel and across, no one had any 
longer the least idea where we were, nor in what 
direction the German lines lay. By degrees we all 
got the wind up. The needles of our compasses 
danced in our hands, and when we looked for the 
Pole-star all we had learned at school evaporated and 
left us in the lurch. The sound of voices in the next 
trenches warned us that the enemy had recovered from 
the shock of surprise. He would be bound soon to 
realize our position. 

After turning about once more I suddenly saw, as I 
brought up the rear, the muzzle of a machine-gun 
waving to and fro over a traverse of sandbags. I 
made a jump at it and came upon Kloppmann and 
Fahnrich Zglinitzky busy with the gun, while Fusilier 
Haller was searching a blood-stained body for papers. 



200 regni£ville 

Without troubling any more about our surroundings 
we began fiddling with the machine-gun in feverish 
haste so that we might at least take back something 
with us. I tried to loosen the retaining screw, another 
cut off the loading belt with wire-cutters; at last we 
got hold of the thing, tripod and all, meaning to take 
it with us without dismounting it. At this moment 
we heard a voice from a trench running parallel to us. 
It came from the direction in which we supposed our 
lines to be. * Qu’est-ce qu’il y a?’ At the same 
time a black blob flew over towards us, indistinctly 
seen against the dim sky. ‘ Look out! ’ It burst 
between Mevius and me, and a splinter got Mevius 
in the hand. 

We scattered in all directions, entangling ourselves 
deeper and deeper in the maze of trenches. With me 
there were only the pioneer sergeant and Mevius. 
Our one hope was the Frenchmen’s alarm; for they 
did not venture yet to come out of their holes. How¬ 
ever, it could only be a matter of minutes before we 
ran into a strong party of them, who would do us 
in with delight. I debated whether I would not 
simply whack the first I met on the head with one of 
the stick bombs that had an instantaneous fuse. There 
was no thought of hands-up. 

When I had given up all hope of getting safely out 
of the wasps’ nest, a cry of joy escaped me. My eye 
had fallen on the saucepan with the spoon, and now 
I knew my direction. As it was now quite light, we 
had not a tnoment to lose. We jumped out of the 
trench and made for our own lines over the top, as 
the first bullets whistled round us. In the French 



REGNlfiVILLE 201 

first line we came on Lieutenant von Kienitz’s party. 
When the cry of ‘ Luttje Lage ! ’ rang out, we knew 
we had the worst behind us. 

Most unfortunately, in jumping into the trench I 
came right on a man who was severely wounded and 
lay in the trench among the others. Kienitz hurriedly 
told me that he had bombed a French working party 
in the front line and had driven it back, and that at 
the very start, when advancing further, he had suffered 
losses in dead and wounded from the fire of our own 
artillery. 

After waiting a longish while, two more of my 
party turned up, the N.C.O. Dujesiefken and Fusilier 
Haller. Haller brought me at least some small consola¬ 
tion. He found himself in his wanderings alone in 
a little sap, and there he discovered three abandoned 
machine-guns, one of which he had unscrewed from its 
stand and brought with him. Now, as it was growing 
lighter every moment, we hurried over No-man’s-land 
into our own front line. 

Of the fourteen men who had gone out with me 
only four came back, and Kienitz’s patrol, too, had 
heavy losses. I was very crestfallen ; but some words 
of the worthy Oldenburger, Dujesiefken, cheered me 
up a little. He was recounting his experiences to a 
group of the men in front of the dugout where I was 
having my hand dressed, and he concluded by saying: 
‘ But Lieutenant Jiinger has won my respect; lads, 
lads, you should see him clear the blocks! ’ Then we got 
together again and marched through the forest to regi¬ 
mental headquarters. Colonel von Oppen gave us coffee. 
He was very much disappointed at our lack of success. 



202 REGNIIiVILLE 

but he expressed his admiration all the same for what 
we had done. Then I was put into a car and driven 
to the division, which required exact information. 
A few hours before, I was storming shell-shot trenches 
in forlorn bombing attacks ; now I enjoyed to the full 
all the luxury of leaning back in a powerful car as it 
purred along over a good road. 

The general staff officer received me in his office, 
and tried in vain to impress upon me that I owed the 
loss of my men to an ill-considered and over-hasty 
advance. I thought: ‘ You can tell me a lot, sitting 
here twenty kilometres behind the line/ and I gave 
him to understand that in the enemy’s front line I had 
neither a green table nor the packs of cards upon it. 
Besides that, all the part I had had was the fighting 
itself; as for the plan, that had been thrust on me 
ready-made, though there was much in it to take 
exception to. I had asked that the objective should 
be altered to the well-marked line of the paved road, 
or at least that coloured lights might be fired from 
our lines in case any of us lost our way. The 
reply had been that this would draw the enemy’s 
fire. But what the devil did the enemy’s fire matter 
to me ? I was used to it. But I was not an owl to 
see my way in the dark ! 

The divisional commander was more agreeable, 
and soon dissipated my low spirits. I sat next him 
at lunch in my torn tunic and with my hand bound 
up, and remembering the saying, ‘ Only fools are 
modest! ’ I took care to put our doings of the morning 
in their true light. 

Next day Colonel von Oppen inspected the patrol 



REGNlfiVILLE 


203 

again, and distributed iron crosses and gave each of us 
fourteen days 1 leave. At mid-day those of the fallen 
who were brought in were buried in the military 
cemetery at Thiaucourt. Among this year’s graves 
are some of 1870-71. One of these old graves had a 
mossy stone with the inscription : 4 Far from our sight 
but always near our hearts.’ Cut on a large tablet 
of stone were the following lines :— 

Heroes* deeds and heroes* graves 
Rank themselves beside the old. 

How to win and how to keep . . . 

Here is told. 

In the evening I read in the French conmmiqui , 
4 A German raid near Regniiville failed. We made 
prisoners.’ It was not stated that the prisoners were 
taken only because we lost our way in seeking an 
enemy who had fled before us. Had the French 
defended their trenches as soldiers of courage do, it 
would have been a different story. 

I had a letter some months later from one of the 
missing, Fusilier Meyer. He had lost a leg in a fight 
with bombs. After long wanderings he and three 
others had been engaged by the enemy. When the 
others, among whom was the brave N.C.O. Klopp- 
mann, had fallen, he himself had been taken prisoner, 
severely wounded. 

I have been in many adventures during the war, but 
not one was more uncomfortable. It gives me the 
blues even now whenever I think of our wanderings 
through those unknown trenches in the cold light 
of dawn.

A few days afterwards Domeyer and Ziirn, both 
lieutenants, jumped into the French front line with 
a few men and no more preparation than a few shrapnel 
shells. Domeyer ran into a French soldier, who 
replied to his * Rendez-vous ! ’ with a grim * Ah non,’ 
and set upon him. After a stern tussle Domeyer 
shot him through the neck with his revolver, and had 
to come back, like me, without a prisoner. The 
difference was that for my attempt as much ammuni¬ 
tion was shot away as would have sufficed for an 
entire battle of 1870. 



FLANDERS AGAIN 


O N the very day that I came back from 
(leave we were relieved by the Bavarian 
Reserve Infantry Regiment No. 5. We then 
went into quarters in Labry, a village in the 
neighbourhood dirty enough to be typical of it. 
The vain search for a water-closet is the outstand¬ 
ing memory one has of the villages of Lorraine. 
Baths appear to be unknown. I have had some 
strange experiences of this description in France. 
One has to pass with a smile over certain shady 
sides of even the most magnificent mansions. 
Much as I esteem the French, I cannot help 
thinking that this is a characteristic side of their life. 
I know indeed that hostile races always call each 
other dirty, and that we were ourselves called 1 sales 
Boches * by the French. Nevertheless, I feel we are 
fully justified in returning this compliment to the 
Latin races. 

On the 17th of October 1917 we were entrained, 
and after a day and a half trod the soil of Flanders 
once more, after an absence of two months. We spent 
the night in the little town of Iseghem, and next morn- 
i ng marched to Roulers or, in Flemish, Rouselaere. The 
town was in the first stages of devastation. Things 
were still for sale in the shops, but the inhabitants were 
already living in their cellars, and their ordinary way 
of life was being broken up by frequent bombardments. 
A milliner’s window opposite my billet seemed to me 

20s 



206 


FLANDERS AGAIN 


to be very much out of place in the tumult of war. 
By night looters tried to break into the houses of 
those who had already left. 

I was the only person in my billet in the Ooststraat 
to occupy rooms above the ground-level. The house 
belonged to a cloth-merchant, who had fled at the 
beginning of the war and left an old housekeeper and 
her daughter to look after it. They took care of a 
small orphaned girl whom they had found during our 
advance, forsaken by her parents and wandering lost 
in the streets. They knew neither her name nor her 
parents. They had an extreme fear of bombs, and 
besought me almost on their knees to have no light 
upstairs, in case of attracting the hateful bombers. 
However, I found I had laughed once too often. I 
was standing with Lieutenant Reinhardt at the window 
and watching an English machine skim low over the 
roofs in the beam of a searchlight. Suddenly an 
immense bomb burst close by, and the window panes 
flew in splinters about our ears. 

I was appointed intelligence officer in the coming 
operations, and attached to the regimental staff. To 
get my bearings I went, before we took over, to the 
headquarters of the ioth Bavarian Reserve Regiment, 
that we were to relieve. I found the C.O. very 
friendly, though at first he growled something about 
my * red band.* By that time I had long given 
up attaching any importance to a war-worn uniform. 
The new hand is known everywhere by other tokens 
than these. 

Two orderlies took me to the so-called Meldekopf, 
which was said to give a very good view of the 



FLANDERS AGAIN 


207 

front. We had scarcely left headquarters when a 
shell fell near us. I was still, apparently, to be ‘ the 
well-beloved son of Chaos/ 

Towards mid-day the shells came over in an inces¬ 
sant thunder, but my guides cleverly avoided them by 
the course they took across a country that was marked 
by numerous little poplar plantations. They worked 
their way forward through the lovely autumn land¬ 
scape, with the instinct of the soldier of modern war¬ 
fare, who even in the heaviest fire can hit on a path 
that at least offers even chances. 

We arrived at a lonely farm, where there were signs 
of recent shell-bursts. At the yard gate a dead man 
lay face downwards. 

‘ Settled him ! * said one of the sturdy Bavarians. 

‘ Dirty weather ! ’ said the other, and hurried on 
after a look at the sky. 

The Meldekopf lay on the far side of the much- 
shelled Passehendaele-Westroosebeke road. It was 
an intelligence clearing-station like the one I had had 
in my charge at Fresnoy. Situated near a house 
that had been shot to a heap of rubbish, it was 
so little protected that the first honest hit would 
blow it to pieces. Three officers were leading a 
sociable cave-life there, but they were very much de¬ 
lighted by the prospect of a speedy relief, and gladly 
told me all I wanted to know about the enemy, and 
the front, and the approaches to the line. After this 
I returned to Roulers by way of Roodkruis and Oost- 
nieuwkerke, and made my report to the commanding 
officer. 

As I went through the streets of the town I read 



208 


FLANDERS AGAIN 


the homely names of the numerous little inns that 
express the snug Flemish life so well. Who would 
not be drawn by a signboard with the title ‘ Die Zalm ’ 
(salmon), ‘ De Reeper 1 (heron), * Die Nieue Trom- 
pette,’ ‘ De Drei Konigen,’ or * Den Olifant 1 ? Does 
it not echo Teniers and de Coster ? At the very out¬ 
set one is put at one’s ease by the homely speech and 
the confiding * du.’ May this enchanting country 
get back its old life again after the frightful wounds 
of war ! 

In the evening the town was bombed once more. 
I went down to the cellar, and found the women 
huddled in a corner. I turned on my electric torch 
to comfort the little girl. She was crying for terror 
in the dark, for a bomb had extinguished the light. 
Here was another sign of the tenacity with which 
people cling to their homes. In spite of the violence 
of their fear, these women embraced the very soil 
that might at any moment be their grave. 

On the morning of the 22nd October I started for 
Kalve with my troop of four men. It was here 
that the staff of the regiment was to take over in the 
course of the morning. There was very heavy shelling 
on the front, and the flashes gave the early morning 
mist the appearance of an effervescent blood-red 
vapour. A house at the entrance of Oostnieuwkerke 
was hit by a heavy shell, and collapsed with a roar 
when we were not far from it. Bits of stone rolled 
about the road. We tried to make a detour, but had 
to go through the town as we did not know the way by 
Roodkruis. As I was hurrying by, I asked the way of 
a N.C.O. who was standing at a cellar entrance. 



FLANDERS AGAIN 


209 

Instead of replying, he dug his hands into his pockets 
and shrugged his shoulders. I had no time to lose, 
considering the shells that were coming over; so I 
leapt upon this blunder of military education and 
extorted the information at the point of my revolver. 

This was the first time I ever found any one in the 
fighting area who made difficulties, not from cowardice, 
but just because he wanted to. Though this state of 
mind naturally grew more general in the last years of 
the war, yet such an expression of it in the course of 
operations was extremely unusual, since battle is like 
an opiate whose immediate effect is to stimulate the 
nerves, though the subsequent effect is to deaden 
them. On the other hand, it was when marching out 
of the line after a * show ’ that you found clearest indi¬ 
cations of crumbling morale. 

Matters became more serious round Roodkruis, a 
small farm at a fork of the road. Limbers were going 
like mad along the shelled road, infantry wound in 
file through the fields on either side of it, and a string 
of wounded dragged themselves along to the rear. A 
young artilleryman had a long jagged splinter sticking 
out from his shoulder. We turned off the road to 
the right to regimental headquarters, which were in a 
ring of shell-fire. Two signallers were laying tele¬ 
phone wire in a field of cabbages near by. A shell 
went up close beside one of them. We saw him fall, 
and took it he was finished. However, he picked 
himself up and with admirable sang-froid continued 
unrolling his wire. As headquarters were no more 
than a tiny concrete blockhouse, where there was 
scarcely room for the commanding officer and his 

o 



210 


FLANDERS AGAIN 


staff, I had to seek quarters elsewhere. With the intelli¬ 
gence, gas, and trench-mortar officers I shared a 
flimsy wooden hut that was scarcely the ideal of a 
bomb-proof shelter. 

In the afternoon I went up the line, as a report had 
come in that the enemy had that morning made an 
attack on our 5th Company. My way took me over 
the Meldekopf to * Nordhof,’ a farm shelled out of all 
recognition, beneath whose ruins dwelt the command¬ 
ing officer of the battalion in reserve. Thence a track 
that was still just to be discerned led to the C.O. of 
the troops in the line, The vast field of shell-holes 
had been turned into a sea of mud by the heavy rain 
of the last days. Its depths were particularly danger¬ 
ous in the low-lying ground of the Paddebeek. On 
my zigzag course I passed many a lonely and forgotten 
corpse. Often only a head or a hand projected from 
the shell-hole whose circle of dirty water reflected 
them. Thousands sleep like that, without one token 
of love to mark the unknown grave. 

I crossed the Paddebeek after the utmost exertions, 
and only with the help of some poplars that a shell 
had flung across it; and found the officer in command 
of the 5th Company, Lieutenant Heins, in a giant 
shell-hole, with what remained of his company around 
him. Their shell-hole line lay on a slope, and, since 
it was not entirely flooded, might be called habitable 
by the unassuming front-line soldier. 

Heins told me that the English had come on in line 
that morning, but had disappeared when fire was 
opened on them. The enemy had, however, shot a 
few men of the 164th Regiment who had lost their 



FLANDERS AGAIN 211 

way and ran for it at their approach. Apart from this 
all was in order; and I returned forthwith to head¬ 
quarters and made my report to the commanding 
officer. 

On the following day we were most rudely inter¬ 
rupted at lunch by a few shells planted right in front 
of the door. Descending fountains of soil beat long 
tattoos on our tarred roof. There was a rush for the 
door. I fled to a farm close at hand, and as it was 
raining I went inside. In the evening the same per¬ 
formance was repeated ; only this time, as it was fine, 
I stood outside the farmhouse. The next shell fell 
right in the middle of it. Such are the chances of war. 
Here more than anywhere it is a case of little causes 
and great effects. Seconds and millimetres make the 
difference. 

On the 28th we were driven from the huts by eight 
o’clock, and one of those opposite us got a direct hit 
at the second shot. Others fell in the water-logged 
meadows. They made less noise, but they scooped 
out some fine holes. Prompted by the experiences 
of the day before, I sought out a lonely shell-hole, of 
dimensions to inspire confidence, in the cabbage-field 
behind headquarters, and I would never leave it again 
until a considerable safety margin had elapsed. I 
heard that day the news, particularly distressing to 
me, of the death of Lieutenant Brecht. He had met 
his heroic death in the shell-hole area to the right of 
the Nordhof, while acting as a divisional observation 
officer. He was one of those few who were encircled 
by a nimbus of romance, even in the most material 
of wars, owing to their insatiable daredevilry. Men 



212 FLANDERS AGAIN 

like him always stood out from the common run ; they 
laughed every time an attack was ordered. 

The morning of the 26th was occupied by drum-fire 
of unusual intensity. Our artillery, too, doubled its 
fury when the signals for a barrage went up in the 
front line. Every little bit of wood and every hedge 
was crammed with guns, and behind them the half- 
dazed gunners were kept hard at work. 

As the reports of the wounded about an English 
attack were confused and exaggerated, I was sent 
forward at eleven with my four men to obtain more 
exact information. We had to pass through a sharp 
fire, and met a great number of wounded, among them 
Lieutenant Spitz, commanding the 12th Company, 
wounded in the chin. Even before reaching the 
headquarters of the battalion in the line we were in a 
direct machine-gun fire, a sign that the enemy must 
have broken through. This fear was soon confirmed 
by Major Dietlein, commanding officer of the 3rd 
Battalion. I found the old gentleman in the act of 
creeping out of the entrance of his blockhouse, which 
was three parts under water, and fishing zealously 
for his meerschaum cigar-holder, which had fallen into 
the mud. The enemy had broken through the front 
line and taken a ridge from which he commanded the 
important area of the Paddebeek and battalion head¬ 
quarters situated there. 

After I had marked the alteration of the front in blue 
chalk on my map, I set out on a fresh steeplechase 
through the mud with my men. We ran at full speed 
over the exposed ground till a slope gave us cover, and 
then we proceeded more slowly to Nordhof. Shells 



FLANDERS AGAIN 


213 

were falling to right and left in the boggy ground, and 
throwing up large mountains of mud surrounded by 
countless smaller ones. Nordhof was being shelled 
with H.E. in a nerve-shattering manner, and we had 
to reach it in jumps. The noise these things made 
was really most hideous and quite deafening. They 
came over in groups at short intervals. The only thing 
to do was to cover the ground in short darts, and then 
wait for the next shots in a shell-hole. The interval 
between the first distant howl and the explosion 
near by is marked by a peculiarly painful emphasis 
upon the instinct of self-preservation, since the body 
is reduced to a state of defenceless and motionless 
waiting. But I am afraid my insistence on the fact 
that the war was no child's-play will become burden¬ 
some. The picture of every day was at last made up 
of such experiences. 

There was shrapnel, too, among the rest. One 
of them scattered its bullets with a clatter among us, 
and one of my men was hit on the hind rim of his 
helmet and thrown to the ground. After he had lain 
stunned for some while, he picked himself up and ran 
on. The ground round Nordhof was strewn with 
terribly mutilated bodies. 

As we carried out our job in a sporting spirit, 
we were often in places that had just ceased to be 
possible. In this way the unseen events of the 
battlefield came to our eyes. We were everywhere 
pressing on the heels of death. It was almost as 
though not one living soul was to be found in this 
desolation. Here lay a group behind a tattered hedge, 
their bodies covered by the still fresh earth that 



214 


FLANDERS AGAIN 


showered on them after the shell had burst; there, 
two runners near a shell-hole, from which the 
suffocating vapour of the explosives still exhaled. 
At other spots there were many corpses scattered 
over a small surface—a carrying-party caught in a 
vortex of shell-bursts, or a strayed platoon coming up 
in support, had found an end here. We appeared, 
took in the drama at one glance, and disappeared 
into the smoke again. 

When we had safely crossed the much-shelled bit of 
ground behind the Passchendaele-Westroosebeke road, 
I was able to give intelligence to the commander of 
the regiment. 

Next morning I was despatched to the front line 
at six o’clock, to ascertain whether and where the 
regiment was in touch with the units on its flanks. 
On the way I met Sergeant-major Ferchland, who 
had to take the orders to the 8th Company to advance 
on Goudberg and fill the gap, if there should be one, 
between us and the regiment on the left. The quickest 
way to carry out my task was to go along with him. 
After a long search we found my friend Tebbe, com¬ 
manding the 8th Company, in an inhospitable part 
of the shelled area near the Meldekopf. He was not 
particularly pleased at the notion of executing the 
proposed movement in broad daylight. We lit cigars 
while waiting for the company to assemble, and 
conducted a laconic conversation in the dreary and 
oppressive surroundings that the morning light 
revealed. 

Before we had gone a few steps we were under rifle- 
fire from high ground in front, and we had to go 



FLANDERS AGAIN 


215 

forward by jumps from one shell-hole to the other, 
each man on his own. As we went across the next 
rise the fire was so concentrated that Tebbe gave the 
order to take up a position in shell-holes until night 
came on. Smoking his cigar, he went with great 
coolness along the whole length of his front. I 
decided to go on and ascertain the width of the gap, 
and first I rested awhile in Tebbe’s shell-hole. Soon 
the enemy artillery began to resent the company’s 
imprudent advance, and got the range of the strip of 
ground we were on. A bit of shell that struck our 
refuge, throwing the soil over my map and into my 
eyes, gave me the tip to go. I bade farewell to Tebbe, 
and wished him good luck for the hours ahead. He 
called after me : ‘ God send the night; the morning 
will come of itself.’ 

We made our way cautiously through the low-lying 
ground of the Paddebeek, which was overlooked by 
the enemy, taking cover behind the branches shot 
away from the poplars and using their trunks as a 
bridge. Now and then one of us sank in mud above 
the hips and would certainly have drowned but for 
the rifle-butts that the others stretched out to help 
him up. I chose as our objective a group of men 
standing round a concrete blockhouse. In front of 
us, moving in the same direction, there were four 
stretcher-bearers carrying a stretcher. It made me 
suspicious to see a wounded man being carried forward, 
so I took my glasses and then saw a line of khaki- 
coloured figures with flat helmets. At the same 
moment the first shots snapped out. As there was 
no cover to take, we ran, and the bullets spurted the 



216 FLANDERS AGAIN 

mud up on all sides of us. The chase through the 
morass was frantically exhausting, and when com¬ 
pletely pumped we had to stop for a while and give 
the English a good target; but a few H.Es. soon restored 
us to our first vigour. All the same, they had the 
advantage of concealing us from the enemy in their 
smoke. The worst feature of this run was knowing 
that a wound would drown one for certainty in a 
mud-hole. A suffusion of blood on the surface of a 
shell-hole here and there showed that many a man 
had vanished thus. 

I was dead tired when we reached headquarters. I 
gave in my sketch and made a report on the situation. 

On the 28th October we were relieved again by the 
10th Bavarian Reserve Regiment, and quartered among 
the villages behind the line, to be put in again at any 
moment. The staff moved to Most. 

In the evening we were sitting in a deserted inn. 
We were already in the best of spirits again and 
celebrating the promotion of Lieutenant Ziirn, who 
had been mentioned in despatches and had just come 
back from leave. As a punishment for our light¬ 
heartedness we were awakened next morning by 
gigantic drum-fire that blew in my window-panes 
in spite of our distance from it. Immediately after, 
the alarm was given. There was a rumour that the 
enemy had broken through by the gap that still per¬ 
sisted on the regiment's left flank. I spent the day 
waiting for orders at the artillery observation post, the 
neighbourhood of which was being sporadically shelled. 
A light shell went through the window of a small 
house and drove out three gunners, wounded and 



FLANDERS AGAIN 217 

covered with brick-dust. The corpses of three others 
remained beneath the wreckage. 

The morning after I had the following orders 
from the commanding officer of the Bavarians: 

‘ Owing to repeated attacks by the enemy the 
front of the regiment on the left flank has been 
still further pushed back, and the gap between 
the regiments greatly widened. As there was danger 
of our flank being turned from the left, the 1st 
Battalion of the 73rd Fusiliers counter - attacked 
yesterday. Apparently, however, it was dispersed by 
the barrage and never reached the enemy. This 
morning the 2nd Battalion was sent forward to close 
the gap. So far no news has been received. In¬ 
formation is now required as to the position of 
the 1st and 2nd Battalions.’ 

I set out, and had only got as far as Nordhof when 
I met Captain von Brixen, commanding officer of the 
2nd Battalion, who had a sketch-map of the disposition 
of the troops ready to hand in his pocket. I took a 
copy of it, and with this my task was really completed. 
However, I went on all the same to the head¬ 
quarters of the troops in the line, which I found in 
a concrete block-house, in order to make a personal 
reconnaissance. 

On the way I passed great numbers of recent 
casualties. The white faces stared out of the brimming 
shell-holes or were already so mud-bespattered that 
the human face was scarcely recognizable. I was sorry 
to see the blue Gibraltar badge on most of them. The 
commanding officer was a Bavarian, Captain Radlmaier, 
a very energetic officer. He gave me full details of 



218 FLANDERS AGAIN 

the position that Captain von Brixen had hastily told 
me of. Our 2nd Battalion had suffered heavy losses, 
among them the adjutant and the officer commanding 
the valiant 7th Company. The fate of the adjutant, 
Lieutenant Lemiere, was particularly tragic, as his 
brother had been killed the April before at Fresnoy, 
in command of the 8th Company. Both brothers 
belonged to the principality of Liechtenstein, but they 
had joined the army out of enthusiasm for the cause 
of Germany. It is fatal for two sons to be in one 
regiment in wartime. We had four pairs of brothers 
among the officers of the regiment. Of these eight, five 
were killed, and two, one of whom was my brother, 
were severely wounded. I was the only one to come 
through in a fairly sound state. This little example 
shows the losses of the Fusiliers. 

The captain pointed to a concrete post about two 
hundred metres in front of our line, which had been 
defended with particular heroism the day before. 
Shortly after the attack began, the commander of 
this little strong-point, a sergeant-major, saw an English¬ 
man who was taking off three German prisoners. 
He shot the Englishman and added the three to the 
strength of his garrison—though it did not appear 
that he found in them an exactly heroic trio. When 
they had shot away their ammunition they tied an 
Englishman in front of the entrance as a peaceful 
signboard, and at dark succeeded after all in escaping 
unobserved. 

Another strong-point, commanded by a lieutenant, 
was summoned to surrender. Instead of making an 
answer, the German leapt out and, seizing the English 



FLANDERS AGAIN 


219 

officer, dragged him inside before the eyes of his 
bewildered men. 

That day, for the only time in the war, I saw small 
bodies of stretcher-bearers moving about in the open 
with the Red Cross flag without a shot being fired. 
Such a sight was unknown to the front-line soldier 
in this subterranean war except when matters were 
very desperate. Nevertheless, I heard later on that 
some of our stretcher-bearers had been shot by 
English snipers. 

This fact may seem astounding, and yet I can explain 
it to myself. Weak natures are prone to the atavistic 
impulse to destroy; and it takes hold of the trench 
fighter in his desolate existence when any one appears 
above ground. I have felt it myself only too often. 

I had an unpleasant time on my way back owing 
to the irritant gas of the English shells. The ground 
was saturated with it. It smelt of rotten apples and 
made the eyes run. After making my report to head¬ 
quarters I met two stretchers just outside the dressing- 
station at Kalve. On each, severely wounded, was an 
officer whom I knew well. One was Lieutenant ZUrn, 
in whose honour we had made a night of it only two 
evenings before. Now he lay half-undressed on a 
door. His face had that hint of yellow which is the 
certain precursor of death, and he looked at me with 
fixed eyes when I went up to take his hand. The 
other, Lieutenant Haverkamp, had the bones of a 
leg and an arm so shattered by a shell that an amputa¬ 
tion was extremely probable. He was as white as 
death, and he lay on his stretcher with his features 
heroically set, smoking a cigarette. 



220 


FLANDERS AGAIN 


Our losses in young officers were again frightfully 
heavy during these days. Every time afterwards that 
I heard prejudice and depreciation on the lips of the 
mob, I thought of these men who saw it out to the 
bitter end with so little parade and with so fine an 
ardour. But after all—what is the mob ? It sees 
in everything nothing but the reflection of its own 
manners. It is quite clear to me that these men 
were our best. However cleverly people may talk 
and write, there is nothing to set against self-sacrifice 
that is not pale, insipid, and miserable. 

On the 3rd of November we entrained at Gits, 
whose situation was familiar to us from our earliest 
Flanders days. We found that the two Flemish girls 
had lost their old freshness. They, too, seemed to 
have lived through days of battle in the meantime. 

Next, we were for some days in rest at Tourcoing, 
an imposing sister-city of Lille. For the first time 
and the last during the war, every man of the 7th 
Company slept on a feather-bed. I occupied a 
magnificently furnished room in the house of an in¬ 
dustrial magnate in the Rue de Lille. The first 
evening, with an open fire, the indispensable marble 
mantelpiece, and an armchair, was unspeakably de¬ 
lightful. 

The few days were passed by everybody in enjoying 
life that had been so hardly won. It was still scarcely 
believable that death had been escaped, and it seemed 
a necessity to assure oneself of it by enjoying life in 
every aspect. 



THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI 


T HE delightful days at Tourcoing were soon 
over. For a short while longer we were at 
Villers-au-Tertre, where we were made up to 
strength by new drafts, and then we went by train on 
the 15th November to L£cluse, the rest-place of the 
battalion in reserve on the new front now assigned 
to us. Lecluse was a fairly large village of Artois, 
surrounded by lakes. The immense reedy marshes 
concealed ducks and water-fowl, and the water was 
alive with fish. Though fishing was strictly forbidden, 
mysterious sounds were often heard on the water at 
night. One day, too, I had presented to me by the 
town-major a few paybooks of men in my company 
who had been caught fishing with bombs. I wasted 
no words over that, however ; for the good spirits of 
the men were very much more to me than the pro¬ 
tection of French fishing-waters or the dinner-tables 
of the resident military magnates. After this a 
gigantic pike was laid on my table nearly every evening 
by an unknown hand, and on the next day I gave my 
two company officers a meal, at which the principal 
dish was 1 Pike & la Lohengrin.’ (Ask me no 
more !) 

On the 19th I inspected our position in the line with 
my platoon commanders, as we were going in in a day 
or two. It was in front of the village of Vis-en-Artois. 
We were not so soon in the line as we expected, as 
there was an alarm nearly every night, and on account 

Ml 



222 


THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI 


of an English attack that was supposed to be coming 
off we were held in readiness by turns in the Wotan 
line, the reserve gun positions, or in Dury village. 
Those who had war experience could see that some¬ 
thing unpleasant would come of it. 

On the 29th November we were, in fact, told by our 
commanding officer, Captain von Brixen, that we 
were to take part in a highly-organized counter-attack 
to straighten the bulge that the Cambrai tank-battle 
had made in our front. We were delighted, certainly, 
to change the part of the anvil for that of the hammer 
at last; but we had some reservations on account of 
the men, after their recent exhaustion in Flanders. 
Nevertheless, I had entire confidence in the spirit of 
my company and its iron backbone, in my experienced 
platoon commanders and excellent N.C.Os. 

On the night of November 30th-December 1st we 
were put on lorries. It was in the course of this that 
my company had its first casualties. One of the 
men let a bomb fall and for some mysterious reason 
it went off and severely wounded him and one other. 
Another man, in the hope of getting sent back, pretended 
to be mad. I did not know whether to laugh or to 
storm at him. Finally he recovered his reason at the 
suggestion of a N.C.O., who gave him a powerful dig 
in the ribs ; and we were all able to get in. We were 
conveyed, tightly packed together, almost as far as 
Baralle, and there we waited hour after hour for orders 
in the ditch by the roadside. In spite of the cold I 
lay down in a grass field and slept till dawn. We were 
somewhat disappointed when we were told that the 
225th Regiment were going over the top without our 



THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI 223 

assistance. Pending developments we were to stand 
by in the park of the chateau of Baralle. 

At 9 o’clock our artillery broke into heavy bursts 
of fire, and increased between 11.45 and 11.50 to drum¬ 
fire. Bourlon wood, which owing to the strength of 
its defences had been left out of the frontal attack, 
disappeared under yellowish-green clouds of gas. At 
11.50 we saw the attacking waves through glasses, as 
they emerged upon the vacant expanse of shell-holes ; 
while further back, batteries harnessed up and raced 
forward to new positions. A German scout shot down 
an English captive balloon in flames, and the observer 
jumped out with a parachute. 

After enjoying this panorama of battle from the high 
ground of the park we emptied a dixie of dumplings, 
and in spite of the cold laid ourselves down on the 
ground for an afternoon sleep. At 3, orders came 
through to go forward as far as regimental head¬ 
quarters, which were concealed in the lock of a drained 
canal. We covered this distance in detachments under 
moderate and scattered shell-fire. 

From there the 7th and 8th Companies were sent 
forward to report to the officer commanding the 
troops in reserve, so as to relieve two companies 
of the 225th. The five hundred metres we had 
to go along the bed of the canal were covered by 
a band of fire. We ran in one mob and reached 
our goal without a casualty. There were numerous 
dead here to show that many a company had paid 
heavy toll. Reserves were crowded along the sides 
of the canal and were feverishly digging out holes 
in the retaining walls to serve as cover. As the 



224 THE battle of cambrai 

whole space was occupied, and as the canal was a 
landmark that drew the enemy’s fire, I led the company 
off to the right among the shell-holes and gave orders 
for each man to see to himself. A splinter rang 
against my bayonet. Lieutenant Tebbe had followed 
my example with the 8th Company, and now we 
looked out a suitable shell-hole and covered it with a 
ground-sheet. We then lit a candle, ate our supper, 
lit our pipes, and talked and shivered. At eleven 
o’clock I got orders to proceed to the former front line 
and to report to the C.O. of the battalion in the line, 
under whose orders the 7th Company was. I gave 
the order to fall in and led the company forward 
There were only isolated shells, but very heavy ones. 
One of them that crashed in front of us was like a 
glimpse of hell, and filled the whole canal-bed with 
black vapour. The men were dumbfounded as 
though by a blow of an iron fist on the nape of the 
neck, and stumbled hurriedly on behind me over 
barbed wire and stone rubble. 

A feeling of indescribable discomfort steals upon 
the nerves, even though the shell-fire is not particularly 
heavy, when one is traversing an unfamiliar part of 
the line by night. The strangest illusions play upon 
the eye and ear, and the menacing walls of the trench 
inspire a sense of loneliness, like that of a child that 
has lost its way on a dark heath. 

At last we found the narrow mouth of the first line 
in the wall of the canal, and went on through over¬ 
crowded trenches to battalion headquarters. I went 
in and found a mob of officers and orderlies in an 
atmosphere that could be cut with a knife. I was 



THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI 225 

told that the attack on the front had not achieved 
much and that it was to be renewed the next morning. 
The feeling in the air was not very hopeful. Two 
commanding officers began a long discussion with 
their adjutants. Now and then from the height of 
their bunks, that were as crowded as hen-roosts, the 
specialist officers threw a few crumbs into the debate. 
The cigar fumes were suffocating. Batmen endeavoured 
to cut bread for their officers in the throng. A wounded 
officer who burst in aroused a passing alarm with the 
news of an enemy bombing attack. 

Finally I was able to take down my orders for the 
attack. At 6 a.m. I and my company were to roll up 
Dragon Alley and as much of the Siegfried line as 
possible. The two battalions of the regiment in the 
line were to attack on our right at 7. 

This difference of time aroused my immediate and 
resolute dislike. I raised a number of objections to 
splitting up the attack in this way, and gained my 
point. We, too, were to attack at 7. We found out 
the importance of this alteration the next morning. 
Fighting experience in an officer commanding troops 
can often, in cases like this, spare much unnecessary 
bloodshed. 

A company detached from its own unit is not likely 
to be pampered under alien command. As I had only 
the haziest notion of the whereabouts of Dragon Alley, 
I asked, as I was going, for a map. Unfortunately, 
not a single one could be spared. I made a silent 
comment and went out. 

After I and the men with their heavy packs had 
wandered up and down the trenches for a long while, 

p 



226 THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI 

one of the men discovered a board with the scarcely 
legible inscription, ‘ Dragon Alley.’ It was at the 
entrance of a narrow trench branching off to the front 
•and blocked with knife-rests. After entering it, and 
before I had gone many paces, I heard voices in 
a foreign tongue. I was very much astonished to find 
the enemy so close, and indeed almost in our own 
lines, without having come upon any measures of 
defence ; and I at once posted a section to block the 
trench. 

Close to Dragon Alley there was an enormous pit, 
apparently a tank-trap. There I collected the whole 
company and explained the plan of attack and assigned 
their respective parts to each platoon. My remarks 
were interrupted several times by light shells. Once, 
even, a dud hurtled against the rear wall of our pit. 
Standing on the edge above, I saw a deep and regular 
inclination of the moonlit helmets at every hit. 

I took the precaution of sending the first and second 
platoons back into the trench, in case of an unlucky 
direct hit, and remained with the third in the pit. 
Some men of a party which had come to grief in 
Dragon Alley the day before put the wind up my men 
by telling them that fifty metres along there was an 
English machine-gun that made further advance im¬ 
possible. In view of this tale, I made it understood 
with the platoon commanders that at the first resist¬ 
ance we should jump out on both sides of the trench 
and make a concerted bombing attack. It is more 
than ever important to keep up a regiment’s fighting 
prestige when attached to another unit. I spent the 
endless hours squeezed up against Lieutenant Hopf 



THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI 227 

in a small hole. I got up at six and made the final 
arrangements, in a mood peculiar to the last hour 
before an attack. There’s a lonely, sinking feeling 
in the stomach as one speaks to the section leaders, 
tries to make jokes, and keeps running to and fro as 
if before an inspection by the divisional commander. 
In short, one tries to be as occupied as possible in 
order to escape the thoughts that drill into the brain. 
One of the men offered me a cup of coffee heated in 
a trench cooker. Its warmth cheered me to the 
marrow. 

At 7 sharp we advanced in single file in the pre¬ 
arranged order. We found Dragon Alley unoccupied; 
a number of empty drums behind a block showed that 
the machine-gun must have been withdrawn. Our 
fighting spirit kindled at this. We went along a narrow 
sunken way, after passing on our right a well-built 
trench, where I left a few men posted. The sunken 
road became shallower and shallower till at last we 
found ourselves in the open, just as dawn broke. We 
then turned back and entered the trench on the right. 
It was full of arms and equipment and English dead. 
It was the Siegfried line, and suddenly Lieutenant 
Hoppenrath, the leader of the storming section, 
snatched a rifle from one of the men and fired. He 
had come on an English post, which, after a few 
bombs had been thrown, took to flight. We went 
on, and a moment later a fresh stand was encountered. 
Bombs flew on both sides and burst with resounding 
din. Now the technique of the storm-troop came 
into play. A chain of bombs went from hand to 
hand along the trench. Snipers took up positions 



228 THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI 

behind traverses ready to draw a bead on the enemy 
bombers ; the platoon commanders kept an eye out 
over the top to see a counter-attack in the nick of time; 
and the light machine-gun section mounted their guns 
where there was a good field of fire. 

After a short fight we heard agitated voices from the 
other side, and before we understood what was happen¬ 
ing the first Englishmen came towards us with their 
hands up. One after another turned the corner of 
the traverse and unbuckled his belt while our rifles 
and revolvers were threateningly levelled. They were 
all young, well-set-up fellows in new uniforms. I 
let them pass with the command * Hands down ! ’ 
and detailed a squad to take them to the rear. Most 
of them showed by their confiding smiles that they 
trusted in us as human beings. Others held out 
cigarettes and chocolates in order to conciliate us. 
My enthusiasm and delight when I saw what a bag 
we had made were unbounded. The procession had no 
end. We had counted 150 already, and still they came 
with their hands above their heads. I went up to an 
officer and asked him how far their position extended 
and how many men they had. He answered very 
politely, but impaired the good impression he made 
by being so very stiff about it. He then conducted me 
to the commander of the company, a captain, who was 
lying wounded in a deep dugout near by. He was about 
twenty-eight years old, with a clear-cut face. I found 
him leaning against the timbers at the foot of the shaft 
with a wound through the calf. I introduced myself, 
and he raised his hand to his cap, showing as he did 
so a gold chain. He told me his name and gave up 



THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI 


229 

his revolver. His first words showed that I had a 
man to deal with. ‘ We were surrounded.’ He 
could not rest till he had told his enemy why he 
had allowed his company to be taken prisoners so 
quickly. 

We had a talk on various matters, in French. He 
told me there were a number of German wounded 
in a neighbouring dugout, whom his men had 
bound up and looked after. When I asked him how 
strongly held the Siegfried line was further on, he 
declined to reply. I promised to get him and the 
other casualties sent back, and we parted with a shake 
of the hand. 

Outside, the men reported that we had taken 200 
prisoners, a fine achievement for a company of eighty 
strong. I had guards mounted, and we then looked 
round the captured trench. It was bristling with 
arms and equipment. On the fire-steps were machine- 
guns, mortars, bombs, and rifle-grenades, water- 
bottles, sheepskin waistcoats, mackintosh capes, ground- 
sheets, cases of bully beef, jam, tea, coffee, cocoa, and 
tobacco, bottles of rum, tools, revolvers, Verey-light 
pistols, clothing, gloves; in short, everything imaginable. 
Like an old soldier of fortune I allowed an interval 
for plunder, nor could I resist the temptation myself 
of having a small breakfast prepared for me by my 
batman in a dugout entrance and lighting a pipe of 
the ‘ Navy Cut ’ I had so long been without, while I 
scribbled a report to the commanding officer of the 
troops in the line. Like a wise man, I sent a duplicate 
to our own C.O. 

After half an hour we proceeded, in an exalted mood, 



2 3 o THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI 

to which the English rum may have contributed, 
and stalked from traverse to traverse along the Siegfried 
line. 

We were fired on from a pill-box built into the 
trench, and got on to the next fire-step to study 
the lie of the land. While we were exchanging a 
shot or two with the inmates, a man was struck to 
the ground as though by an invisible hand. A shot 
had pierced the crown of his helmet and torn a long 
groove in his skull. His brain could be seen throbbing 
with each beat of his heart, and yet he was able to 
make his way back alone. 

I called for volunteers to carry the place by assault 
over the top. The men looked at each other in 
hesitation. Only an ungainly Pole, whom I had 
always thought weak in the head, clambered out of 
the trench and stumped off heavily to assault 
the pill-box alone. But now Fahnrich Neupert 
sprang over the top with his section, while we at 
the same time advanced along the trench. The 
English fired a few shots and ran for it, abandoning 
the pill-box to us. One of the Fahnrich’s men was 
shot dead half-way over, and lay with his face to the 
earth a few steps from the goal. 

Going further we met with a resolute resistance 
from some unseen bomb-throwers, and after con¬ 
siderable butchery we were driven back to the 
pill-box. There we made a block. We, as well as 
the English, left a number of dead in the disputed 
length of trench. Among them, unhappily, was the 
N.C.O. Mevius, whom, in the night of Regnidville, 
I had learned to value as a daring fighter. He lay with 



THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI 


231 


his face in a pool of blood. When I turned him over 
I saw a big hole in his forehead and knew that nothing 
could help him. 

After the enemy also had retired a little, an obstinate 
shooting match began. In the course of it a Lewis 
gun, posted fifty metres from us, forced us to duck 
our heads. A light machine-gun on our side took 
the duel on. For half a minute the two murderous 
weapons rattled on at each other, with the bullets 
spurting round them. Then our gunner, the 
volunteer Motullo, was killed by a shot through the 
head. Though his brain fell over his face to his 
chin, his mind was still clear when we took him to 
the nearest dugout. By degrees things calmed down, 
as the English too were busy making a block. 

At 12, Captain von Brixen, Tebbe, and Vogt 
appeared and congratulated me on the company’s 
success. We sat down in the pill-box and lunched 
off the English provisions and discussed the situation. 
Meanwhile I held a conversation in shouts with about 
twenty-five English, whose heads emerged out of the 
trench about a hundred metres in front of us, and who 
apparently wished to give themselves up. As soon 
as I showed myself, however, I was shot at from 
further behind them. 

Suddenly there was a commotion at the barricade. 
Bombs flew, rifles pinged, and machine-guns rattled. 
‘ They ’re coming. They ’re coming.’ We jumped 
to our sandbags and fired away. One of my men, 
the volunteer Kimpenhaus, jumped on to the top 
of the block in the heat of the battle and fired into the 
trench till he fell severely wounded in both arms. I 



232 THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI 

made a note of this hero of the hour, and had the 
pleasure, fourteen days later, of congratulating him on 
the Iron Cross of the ist class. 

We had scarcely gone back to lunch after this little 
interlude when a fresh heathenish alarm broke upon 
us. There followed one of those extraordinary 
episodes in which, great and small, the history of 
the war is so rich. A subaltern of the regiment on 
our left who had come to get into touch with us 
became inspired by a boundless pugnacity. It seemed 
that drink had inflamed his inborn courage to mad¬ 
ness. ‘ Where’s the Tommy ? At the dogs ! Who’s 
coming ? ’ In his rage he pulled down our fine 
block and plunged on, clearing a road for himself 
with a roar of bombs. In front of him, through the 
trench, flitted his orderly, and finished off with his 
rifle those whom the bombs had spared. 

When a man makes him. elf the stake with crazy 
daring his example is always infectious. We were 
all wrought up and, snatching up bombs, ran to take 
part in the improvised assault. I was soon up with 
the fellow, nor did the other officers, followed by 
most of the company, hang back. The C.O. himself, 
Captain von Brixen, was among the foremost. He 
had picked up a rifle, and he shot down several enemy 
bombers over our heads. 

The English resisted valiantly. Every traverse was 
contested. Mills bombs and stick-bombs crossed and 
recrossed. Behind each we found dead or still quivering 
bodies. We killed each other out of sight; and there 
were losses on our side too. A bomb fell close to the 
orderly and burst before he could get clear. He fell 



THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI 


233 

with a dozen wounds, from which his blood trickled 
into the soil. 

We sprang on over his body. Thunderous reports 
gave us our direction. Hundreds of eyes lay in wait 
in the desolation behind rifles and machine-guns. 
We were a long way in front of our own lines. Bullets 
whistled from all sides round our heads or landed 
with a hard smack on the edge of the trench. One 
had to have courage here, and every one had ; other¬ 
wise he would not have ventured on it. Each time 
that one of the egg-shaped bombs appeared the 
eye seized it with a precision only possible to a 
man whose life hangs on the issue. Then one threw 
a bomb oneself and jumped forward. Scarce a glance 
fell on the huddled body of the enemy. He was 
done for, and now a fresh duel began. 

A trench branching off to the right was cleared by 
some men of the 225th Regiment who were following 
us. Caught between two fires, the English tried to 
escape across the open and were shot down like game 
at a * battue.’ 

Then came the climax. The enemy, hard pressed, 
and with us always on his heels, made ready to retire 
by a communication trench that turned away to the 
right. 1 jumped on to a fire-step and saw that this 
trench for a good stretch ran parallel to ours at a 
distance of only twenty metres. So the enemy had 
to pass by us once more. We could look right down 
on the helmets of the English, who stumbled over 
each other in their haste and excitement. I lobbed 
a bomb at the feet of the foremost. They started 
back and crowded on those behind. Now began 



234 THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI 

an indescribable carnage. Bombs flew through the air 
like snowballs till the whole scene was veiled in white 
smoke. Two men handed me bombs ready to throw 
without a moment’s pause. Bombs flashed and 
exploded among the mob of English, throwing them 
aloft in fragments with their helmets. Cries of rage 
and terror were mingled. With the fire in our eyes 
we sprang with a shout over the top. 

In the midst of this tumult I was struck to the earth 
by a terrific blow. Sobered, I tore off my helmet, 
and saw with horror two large holes in it. The 
N.C.O. Mohrmann, who sprang to my help, comforted 
me by the assurance that nothing was to be seen on 
the back of my head but a scratch. The shot of a 
far-distant rifle had pierced my helmet and grazed 
the skull. I was half-dazed and was forced to give 
way. With my head bound up I made my way out 
of the thick of the fight. I had scarcely passed the 
next traverse when a man ran up behind me and gasped 
out that Tebbe had been killed by a shot in the head 
at the very same spot. 

This news finished me. I could scarcely realize 
that a friend with whom for years I had shared joy 
and sorrow and danger, and who had sung out a 
jest to me a few minutes before, had met his end 
from a senseless piece of lead. Unhappily it was 
too true. 

All the leading N.C.Os. and a third of the company 
had fallen too in this murderous piece of trench; 
Lieutenant Hopf, also, an elderly man and a teacher 
by profession, a German 1 Ideal-Schulmeister * in 
the best sense of the word. My two Fahnrichs and 



THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI 


235 

many more were wounded. In spite of this the 7th 
Company held the trench they had gloriously won, 
and remained there under the command of Lieutenant 
Hoppenrath, the only officer left, until the relief of 
the battalion. 

Even modern battle has its great moments. One 
hears it said very often and very mistakenly that the 
infantry battle has degenerated to an uninteresting 
butchery. On the contrary, to-day more than ever 
it is the individual that counts. Every one knows 
that who has seen them in their own realm, these 
princes of the trenches, with their hard, set faces, 
brave to madness, tough and agile to leap forward or 
back, with keen bloodthirsty nerves, whom no de¬ 
spatch ever mentions. Trench warfare is the bloodiest, 
wildest, and most brutal of all warfare, yet it too has 
had its men, men whom the call of the hour has raised 
up, unknown foolhardy fighters. Of all the nerve- 
racking moments of war none is so formidable as 
the meeting of two storm-troop leaders between the 
narrow walls of the trench. There is no retreat and 
no mercy then. Blood sounds in the shrill cry that is 
wrung like a nightmare from the breast. 

On my way back I stopped beside Captain von 
Brixen, who, with a few of the men, was engaged in 
a duel with a row of heads sticking up out of a trench 
running parallel and not far away. I stood between 
him and another and marked where the bullets struck. 

Of a sudden I was again flung down into the trench 
by a blow on the forehead and my eyes were blinded 
with blood. The man beside me fell at the same 
moment and began to cry out. He was shot in 



THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI 


236 

the temple through his helmet. Captain von Brixen 
was afraid he had lost a second company commander 
in one day. However, there was nothing to be found, 
on a closer inspection, except two flesh wounds on 
the edge of my hair, caused, presumably, by the 
bursting bullet or by a splinter from the wounded 
man’s helmet. 

The fresh loss of blood weakened me ; so I agreed 
to return with Captain von Brixen to his headquarters. 
We passed the edge of Moeuvres village at the double 
on account of the heavy shelling, and arrived safely 
at the dugout in the bed of the canal. There I was 
dressed and injected against tetanus. 

In the afternoon I got on to a lorry and went to 
L&fluse, and there dined with Colonel von Oppen, 
who received my report with enthusiasm. After I 
had emptied my bottle of wine, in excellent spirits 
though half asleep, I took my leave. My trusty 
Vinke, whose face beamed with joy, had a bed ready 
for me, and I flung myself into it with a holiday feeling 
after this tremendous day. On the next day but one 
the battalion was taken out and came to L&luse. On 
the 4th December the divisional commander, Major- 
General von Busse, addressed the battalions concerned, 
and mentioned with particular emphasis the services 
performed by the 7th Company. 

I had reason to be proud of my men. A bare 
eighty of them had taken a long stretch of trench, 
besides a large quantity of machine-guns, mortars, 
and war material, and 200 prisoners. Unhappily 
we, too, had a casualty list of fifty per cent., in 
which was a large proportion of officers and N.C.Os. 



THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI 237 

I had the pleasure of announcing a large number of 
promotions and decorations. Lieutenant Hoppen- 
rath, leader of the storm troops, Fahnrich Neupert, 
the stormer of the pill-box, and also the courageous 
defender of the block, Kimpenhaus, were given the 
Iron Cross of the 1st class for their distinguished 
conduct in the field. As a plaster for my fifth wound 
I was given fourteen days’ Christmas leave, and in 
the course of it the Knight’s Cross of the House of 
Hohenzollern with swords was sent to me at home. 
The war ended by giving me peculiar views as to 
orders and decorations, and yet I confess I was proud 
to pin the enamel cross with the gold rim to my breast. 
This cross, my perforated helmet, and a silver cup 
inscribed ‘ To the victor of Moeuvres,’ presented 
to me by the three other company commanders of the 
battalion, are my souvenirs of the battle of Cambrai. 



AT THE COJEUL RIVER 


AFTER a few days on rest we relieved the ioth 
J \ Company in the front line on the 9th 
-^December. Our part of the line was in front 
of Vis-en-Artois, as I mentioned above. My company 
front was bounded on the right flank by the Arras- 
Cambrai road, on the left by the marshy bed of the 
Cojeul river, across which we kept touch with the 
neighbouring company by nightly patrols. The enemy’s 
lines were hidden from sight by a hill lying between the 
front lines. Apart from an occasional patrol messing 
about with our wire at night, and the hum of an electric- 
light engine set up in Hubert’s Farm not far off, we had 
no knowledge of the enemy. On the other hand, the 
frequent gas attacks were unpleasant and claimed many 
victims. They were carried out by means of hundreds 
of iron cylinders buried in the earth and discharged by 
electricity in a salvo of flame. As soon as the light 
showed, gas-alarm was given, and any one who had 
not his mask on and the flap well tucked in found 
himself in a bad way. In many spots, too, the 
gas reached an almost absolute density, so that even 
the mask was useless, since there was literally no 
oxygen there to breathe. Consequently there were 
many casualties. 

My dugout was in the steep wall of a gravel-pit 
behind the line, and was shelled nearly every day. 
Behind, the iron girders of a destroyed sugar-factory 
showed up in grotesque desolation. 

238 



239 


AT THE COJEUL RIVER 

The gravel-pit was an unholy spot. Among the 
shell-holes, filled with the refuse of war, the crosses 
of fallen trench-dwellers stuck up awry. At night 
I could not see my hand in front of my face, and had 
to stand still between Verey lights in case I fell off 
the duck-boards into the marsh at the edge of the 
Cojeul. 

I spent the days, when I was not busied over works 
of construction going on in the trench, in the ice-cold 
dugout, reading a book or drumming my feet against 
the dugout framework to get some warmth into them. 
A bottle concealed in a niche of the chalk served the 
same purpose, and the remedy was sedulously applied 
by my orderlies and me. 

If the smoke of a fire, however small, had wound 
up into the still December sky, the place would have 
become utterly uninhabitable. So far the enemy 
took the sugar-factory to be headquarters and behaved 
accordingly. Thus it was not till evening that we 
came alive. The little stove was then lighted and 
spread genial warmth as well as thick smoke. Soon the 
pots and pans of the ration-party, just returned from 
Vis, clattered down the dugout stairs. They had 
been long and eagerly awaited. And then when the 
eternal rotation of swedes, barley, and dried vegetables 
was interrupted by beans or dumplings, our joy knew 
no bounds. 

As I sat at my little table I used to listen with 
delight to the racy talk of the men crouching in a 
cloud of tobacco smoke over the stove, on which stood 
a pan full of grog diffusing a powerful odour. War 
and peace, battle and home, rest-place and leave, 



240 AT THE COJEUL RIVER 

were discussed in the dry Lower Saxon way. Love, 
too, played a leading part. 

On the 17th of December I went on leave, and came 
back on the 2nd of January. 

On the 19th of January we were relieved at four in 
the morning and marched through snow to Gouy. 
Here we were to stay some while, training for the 
great offensive. LudendorfTs marvellously clear scheme 
of training, which was distributed even to company 
commands, foreshadowed the scope of the coming 
attack. 

We practised skirmishing in line and open warfare 
and did a lot of shooting with the rifle and machine- 
gun. As all the villages behind the line were crammed 
to the attics, every little slope was in use as a range, 
so that the bullets whistled about the country very 
much as in a battle. A machine-gunner of my company 
shot the C.O. of another unit off his horse while he 
was reviewing some troops. Fortunately the wound 
was not mortal, and equally fortunately the deed was 
not clearly brought home to us. 

Sometimes I made practice attacks with the company 
on complicated trench-systems, with live bombs, in 
order to turn to account the lessons of the Cambrai 
battle. Here, too, we had casualties. 

On the 24th of January, Colonel von Oppen, who 
was esteemed by all, left us to take over a brigade 
in the far south-east. The whole regiment keenly 
felt the loss. During the long years of the war he 
had become part of the life of the troops he com¬ 
manded. Besides the warm sympathy he took in 
the destiny of those under his command, he had a 



241 


AT THE COJEUL RIVER 

quality not very common among officers who have 
grown old in the monotony of peace-time soldiering, 
the power to adapt himself to the immense innovations 
brought about by the war. Such a man can effect 
marvels in war-time. Unfortunately his last words, 

4 Auf wiedersehen in Hannover ! ’ did not come true. 
Our beloved colonel saw neither his country nor his 
proud regiment again. He fell a victim to plague, 
and lies in foreign soil, far from his own country. 

On the 6th February we were moved back to Licluse 
again, and on the 22nd we spent four days in the 
shelled area left of the Dury-Hendecourt road, and 
went on working-parties into the front line at night. 

As soon as I saw this part of the line, opposite the 
slag-heaps that used to be Bullecourt, I was certain 
that a part of the great offensive, of which the western 
front was talking with bated breath, would be launched 
at this point. 

Everywhere construction was going forward with 
feverish haste : dugouts sunk, roads laid down. The 
shell-hole area was beset with little placards standing 
in the open and displaying incomprehensible figures 
that denoted presumably the positions of the batteries 
and headquarters. Our aeroplanes flew to and fro 
in a phalanx to prevent observation by the enemy. 
A novelty that interested us on this front was that 
every day precisely at 12 a black ball was let down 
from the observation balloons and disappeared pre¬ 
cisely at 12.XO. This was done to let the troops 
know the exact time. 

Towards the end of the month we marched to 
our old quarters in Gouy. After further battalion 

Q 



242 AT THE COJEUL RIVER 

and brigade rehearsals we twice practised a break¬ 
through of the whole division over prepared ground 
with a whole trench-system marked out. Finally, 
the general commanding the division addressed the 
officers in a way that left no doubt that the offensive 
was to be launched in a few days. The brazen spirit 
of the attack, the spirit of the Prussian infantry, swept 
through the massed troops assembled here in the 
opening spring on the soil of France to go through the 
ordeal of battle. 

If the aim the higher command had in view was not 
attained, it was certainly not the fault of the officers 
and the men. After forty-four months of hard fight¬ 
ing they threw themselves upon the enemy with all the 
enthusiasm of August 1914. No wonder it needed a 
world in arms to bring such a storm-flood to a stand¬ 
still. In the course of time, when the waves of hatred 
have subsided, history will recognize that we fought 
as no people ever fought before. 

It is a pleasure, too, to recall those evenings when 
we sat together round the table and talked, hot-headed, 
of the fresh frolic in front of us—the war of move¬ 
ment. Though our last coins went in wine, what 
need had we of money beyond the enemy’s lines, 
or, indeed, in a better beyond ? 

Who knows but that the world 

To ruin may be hurled ? 

But if it last to-day, 

To-day’s enough! 

On the last evening it needed Captain von Brixen’s 
representation that the staff also had the right to 



AT THE COJEUL RIVER 243 

exist, or we should have smashed glasses, bottles, 
and crockery against the walls. The men, too, were 
in good form. It was enough to hear them talk of 
the coming event as the ‘ Hindenburg flat-race * in 
their dry Lower Saxon way, to know that they would 
take hold as they always did, with an absolute reliability 
and without a word too much. How could one be 
behindhand when these sons of the old oak-encircled 
homesteads went into battle ? The gleam of many 
an ideal that shimmered for me over our war aims 
has been dashed to earth by war. One remains for 
ever : this fidelity that cannot be shaken. 

On the 17th March, towards dusk, we left the 
quarters we had now become very much attached to, 
and marched to Brunemont. All the roads were 
crowded with columns on the march, eagerly pressing 
forward, with countless guns and endless transport. 
Nevertheless, everything went precisely according to 
plans worked out by the general staff. Woe to any 
unit whose movements were not up to scheduled 
time! They were ruthlessly relegated to the ditch 
and had to wait hours before they found a gap into 
which they could squeeze. Once we were caught 
in the scrum and Captain von Brixen’s charger was 
pierced by an iron-tipped waggon-pole and killed. 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


T HE battalion was quartered in the chateau of 
Brunemont. We were told that we were to 
march up the line on the night of March 19th- 
20th, and to occupy the dugouts in the line near 
Cagnicourt, ready to go over the top on the morning 
of March 21st. The task assigned to the regiment 
was to break through between the villages of Ecoust- 
St.-Mein and Noreuil, which we knew from 1915-16, 
on the first day. I sent Lieutenant Schmidt—who 
because of his amiability was never called anything but 
little Schmidt—on ahead to make sure of our quarters. 

The regiment marched out of Brunemont at the 
appointed hour. Their morale was excellent in spite 
of pouring rain. I overlooked a drunken fellow who 
reeled bawling between the files of my company, 
for now any harsh words could only do harm. Train¬ 
ing was over; and now we came to business, not a 
wheel of the machine was to be checked. 

From some cross-roads where guides awaited us 
the companies went forward independently. When 
we got as far as the second line, where we were to 
be quartered, it came out that the guides had lost 
their way. Now began a chase to and fro over the 
dim and sodden shell-hole area and a questioning of 
innumerable troops, who knew as little where they 
were as we did. To prevent the complete exhaustion 
of the men I called a halt and sent out the guides in 
all directions. 

244 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


*45 


Sections piled arms and crowded into a gigantic 
crater, while I and Lieutenant Sprenger sat on the 
edge of a smaller one. There had been single shells 
falling about a hundred metres in front of us for some 
while. Then there was one nearer ; the splinters 
struck the sides of the shell-hole. One of the men 
cried out and said he was hit in the foot. I shouted 
to the men to scatter among the surrounding shell- 
holes, and meanwhile I examined the man’s boot to 
see if there was a hole. Then the whistle of another 
shell high in the air. Everybody had that clutching 
feeling : ‘ It’s coming over ! ’ There was a terrific 
stupefying crash . . . the shell had burst in the midst 
of us. . . . 

I picked myself up half-unconscious. The machine- 
gun ammunition in the large shell-hole, set alight 
by the explosion, was burning with an intense pink 
glow. It illumined the rising fumes of the shell- 
burst, in which there writhed a heap of black bodies 
and the shadowy forms of the survivors, who were 
rushing from the scene in all directions. At the same 
time rose a multitudinous tumult of pain and cries 
for help. 

I will make no secret of it that after a moment’s 
blank horror I took to my heels like the rest and ran 
aimlessly into the night. It was not till I had fallen 
head over heels into a small shell-hole that I under¬ 
stood what had happened. Only to hear and see no 
more ! Only to get away, far away, and creep into a 
hole ! And yet the other voice was heard : * You are 
the company commander, man ! ’ Exactly so. I do 
not say it in self-praise. I might as well say : * When 



246 THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 

God gives an office, He gives the understanding for 
it.’ I have often observed in myself and others that 
an officer’s sense of responsibility drowns his personal 
fears. There is a sticking-place, something to occupy 
the thoughts. So I forced myself back to the ghastly 
spot. On the way I ran into Fusilier Haller, he who 
had bagged the machine-gun on my November patrol, 
and took him along with me. 

The wounded men never ceased to utter their fearful 
cries. Some came creeping to me when they heard 
my voice and whimpered, 1 Sir ... Sir ! * One of 
my favourite recruits, Jasinski, whose leg was broken 
by a splinter, caught hold of me round the knees. 
Cursing my impotence to help, I vainly clapped him on 
the shoulder. Such moments can never be forgotten. 

I had to leave the wretched creatures to the one 
surviving stretcher-bearer and lead the faithful few 
who remained and who collected round me away 
from the fatal spot. Half an hour before I had been 
at the head of a first-rate company at fighting strength. 
Now the few who followed me through the maze of 
trenches where I lost my way were utterly crestfallen. 
A young lad, a milksop, who a few days before had 
been jeered at by his companions because during 
training he had burst into tears over the weight of a 
box of ammunition, was now loyally hulking one along 
on our painful way after retrieving it from the scene 
of our disaster. When I saw that, I was finished. I 
threw myself on the ground and broke into convulsive 
sobs, while the men stood gloomily round me. 

After we had hastened on for hours and to no purpose, 
and often menaced by shells, along the trench ankle- 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


247 


deep in mud and water, we crept, dead tired, into 
some ammunition bays in the side of the trench. My 
batman spread his ground-sheet over me, but the state 
of my nerves kept my eyes wide open, and thus, smoking 
cigars, I waited for daybreak. 

The first light of dawn revealed an utterly incredible 
sight. Countless troops, all over the shelled area, were 
still in search of their appointed shelter. Artillerymen 
were humping ammunition ; trench-mortar men were 
pulling their mortars along; signallers were laying 
wires. There was a regular fair a thousand metres in 
front of the enemy, who, incomprehensibly, appeared 
to observe nothing. 

By good luck I ran across the commander of the 
2nd Machine-gun Company, Lieutenant Fallenstein, 
an old front-line soldier, who was able to show me 
the way to our shelter. The first thing he said was : 
* What makes you look like that, man ?' I led my 
men to a large, deep dugout that we had passed a 
dozen times during the night. There I found little 
Schmidt, who knew nothing of our disaster. The 
guides, also, were there. After that day, whenever 
we moved into a new position I always chose the guides 
myself and with the greatest care. The lessons of 
the war are thorough but costly. 

After settling-in the men who had come with me, 
I went back to the horrible scene of the night before. 
It was a ghastly sight. In a ring round the burst 
were lying over twenty charred corpses, nearly all of 
them unrecognizably mutilated. Some, indeed, we 
had to report as missing, as nothing of them was 
to be found. 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


248 

I came on some soldiers of another unit busied in 
extracting the blood-stained possessions of the dead 
from out of the hideous mess, in the hope of booty. 

I chased the hysenas off, and told my orderly to collect 
the pocket-books and valuables, as far as could be 
done, so that we could send them to their people. 
We had, in any case, to leave them behind when next 
morning we went over the top. 

I was delighted to see Lieutenant Sprenger come 
out of a dugout near by with a number of men who 
had spent the night there. I told the section leaders 
to report, and ascertained that I still disposed of 
sixty-three men. I had set out the night before in 
the best of spirits with a hundred and fifty! I 
succeeded in accounting for over twenty dead and 
over sixty wounded, some of whom died later from 
their injuries. 

The only grain of comfort was that it might have 
been worse. Fusilier Rust, for example, was standing 
so close to the burst that the carrying strap of his box 
began to burn. The N.C.O. Peggau, who, it is true, 
was killed the next day, was standing between two 
men, both of whom were tom to bits, while he had 
not a scratch. 

We spent the day in poor spirits, sleeping mostly. 
I had to go again and again to the C.O., as there was 
always something to do with the attack to arrange. 
Apart from this I lay on a bunk talking to my two 
officers about trifling matters, in order to escape the 
torture of our thoughts. The constant refrain was : 
‘ Thank God, we can only die once.’ I said a few 
words to the men, who crouched together in silence 





THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


*49 

on the steps, with a view to cheering them up; but 
it seemed to have little effect. Nor was I myself 
in an encouraging mood. 

At ten o’clock in the evening a runner brought 
orders to move into the first line. A wild beast 
dragged from its lair, or a sailor who sees the last 
plank swept from his grasp, may, perhaps, have 
feelings comparable to ours when we were compelled 
to leave the warmth and safety of the dugout. Yet 
not one of them was tempted to stay behind un* 
observed. 

We hurried along the Felix trench under sharp 
shrapnel fire and got through without a casualty. 
While we passed along the trench below, guns 
crossed by bridges over our heads to take up forward 
positions. The section of the trench allotted to the 
battalion was quite narrow. Every dugout was filled 
with troops in a moment. The rest had to dig them¬ 
selves holes in the sides of the trench so as to have 
some shelter at least during the bombardment pre¬ 
ceding the attack. At last after much scrambling to 
and fro every one had found his hole. Once more 
Captain von Brixen assembled the company com¬ 
manders for his last remarks. When we had syn¬ 
chronized watches for the last time we shook hands 
and separated. 

I sat down on the steps of a dugout with my two 
officers to wait for 5.5 a.m., the moment when the 
artillery preparation was to begin. The atmosphere 
was slightly more cheerful, as the rain had left off and 
the clear, starry sky promised a fine morning. We 
passed the time eating and talking. Every one 



250 THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 

smoked hard, and the water-bottles went the round. 
In the early hours the enemy artillery was so lively 
that we were afraid the English had smelt a rat. 

Just before zero the following flash signal was 
given us : 4 H.M. the Kaiser and Hindenburg are 
on the scene of operations.’ It was greeted with 
enthusiasm. 

The hands crept on. We counted the last minutes 
as they marked them off. At last they stood at 5.5. 
At once the hurricane broke loose. A curtain of 
flames was let down, followed by a sudden impetuous 
tumult such as was never heard, a raging thunder that 
swallowed up the reports even of the heaviest guns 
in its tremendous reverberations and made the earth 
tremble. This gigantic roar of annihilation from 
countless guns behind us was so terrific that, compared 
with it, all preceding battles were child’s-play. What 
we had not dared to hope came true. The enemy 
artillery was silenced, put out of action by one giant 
blow. We could not stay any longer in the dugouts. 
We got out on to the top and looked with wonder at 
the wall of fire towering over the English lines and the 
swaying blood-red clouds that hung above it. 

Our delight was lessened by the tears and the burning 
of the mucous membrane caused by the fumes of our 
own gas-shells that the wind blew back on us. Many 
of the men were forced to pull off their masks when 
the unpleasant effects of our Blue Cross gas threw 
them into fits of choking and coughing. I was very 
uneasy, yet I felt sure that our command could not 
have made a miscalculation from which our destruc¬ 
tion would necessarily follow. Meanwhile I exerted 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


* 5 * 

all my energy to keep the first cough back so as not 
to increase the irritation. After an hour we were 
able to take off our masks. 

It was now daylight. The terrific tumult behind 
us rose higher and higher. In front stood a blind 
wall of smoke, dust, and gas. Men were running 
along the trench and shouting delightedly into each 
other’s ears. Infantry and artillery, engineers and 
signallers, Prussians and Bavarians, officers and men, 
were all alike in transports over this elemental ex¬ 
pression of German power and were burning with 
impatience for 9.40, when we were to advance to 
the attack. At 8.45 our heavy trench-mortars, that 
stood almost touching one another behind the front 
line, started up. We could see the great two-hundred¬ 
weight bombs fly in a steep trajectory through the 
air and fall to the earth on the other side with 
Hephaestean explosions. Their bursts made a close 
chain of craters in eruption. 

The very laws of nature seemed to have lost their 
validity. The air shimmered as though on a day of 
summer heat. The changing index of refraction made 
fixed objects dance to and fro. Black streaks of shadow 
flitted across the mass of smoke. The roar had 
become a norm and one heard no longer. One could 
scarcely hear the thousands of machine-guns in our 
rear that swept the blue sky with swarm upon swarm 
of lead. 

The last hour of the artillery preparation was 
unhealthier than all the four preceding ones, during 
which we had walked about unheeding on the top. 
The enemy brought a heavy battery into action that 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


252 

landed shell after shell into our crowded trench. 
I went to the left to avoid them, and ran into the 
adjutant, Lieutenant Heins, who asked me if I had 
seen Lieutenant Baron von Solemacher: * He must 
take over the battalion at once. Captain von Brixen 
has just been killed.’ I was shocked at this bad news, 
and went back and sat in a deep burrow in the earth. 
By the time I left there I had utterly forgotten the 
news I had heard. My brain had only one link with 
reality . . . 9.40. It seemed, though, that I was be¬ 
having very courageously, for everybody smiled approv¬ 
ingly when they looked at me. 

The N.C.O. Dujesiefken, a comrade of the Regni^- 
ville patrol, came to a stop in front of my burrow and 
asked me to come out into the trench, as even a light 
shell bursting anywhere near might precipitate the 
whole mass of soil on my head. An explosion took 
the very words from his mouth. He fell to the ground 
with a leg tom off. I sprang over him and fled to the 
right, where I crept to earth again in a hole already 
occupied by two engineers. 

The heavy shells were falling in a narrow circle 
all round us. Suddenly from a white cloud hurtled 
black lumps of soil; as for the detonation, it was lost 
in the general roar. Indeed, the sense of hearing was 
lost. In the piece of trench near us to our left three 
men of my company were tom to pieces. One of the 
last hits, a dud, killed poor little Schmidt, who had 
not left the dugout steps. 

I was standing with Sprenger, with my watch in 
my hand, in front of my burrow, and waiting for the 
great moment. The rest of the company had collected 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


253 

round us. By jokes of a coarseness that unfortunately 
prevents me setting them down here, we succeeded 
in cheering and distracting them. Lieutenant Meyer, 
who peeped for a moment round the traverse, told 
me later that he thought us out of our minds. 

The officer patrols who were to cover our ad¬ 
vance left the trench at 9.10. As our front line 
and the enemy’s were here eight hundred metres 
apart, we had to move forward even during the 
artillery preparation and to take up our position in 
No-man’s-land in readiness to jump into the enemy’s 
front line at 9.40. Sprenger and I climbed out 
on to the top after a few minutes, followed by the 
men. 

‘ Now we ’ll show what the 7th Company can 
do!’ 

‘ I don’t care for anything now.’ 

‘ Vengeance for the 7th Company.’ 

* Vengeance for Captain von Brixen.’ 

We drew our revolvers and crossed our wire, through 
which the first casualties were already trailing back. 

I looked to the left and right. The distribution 
of the host presented a strange spectacle. In shell- 
holes in front of the enemy lines, chinned and churned 
again by the utmost pitch of shell-fire, the attacking 
battalions were waiting massed in companies, as far 
as the eye could see. When I saw this massed might 
piled up, the break-through seemed to me a certainty. 
But was there strength in us to smash the enemy’s 
reserves and hurl them to destruction ? I was con¬ 
fident of it. The decisive battle, the final advance, 
had begun. The destiny of the nations drew to its 



254 THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 

iron conclusion, and the stake was the possession of 
the world. I was conscious, if only in feeling, of the 
significance of that hour ; and I believe that on this 
occasion every man felt his pei .nality fall away in 
the face of a crisis in which he had his part to play 
and by which history would be made. No one who 
has lived through moments like these can doubt that 
the course of nations in the last resort rises and falls 
with the destiny of war. 

The atmosphere of intense excitement was amazing. 
Officers stood upright and shouted chaff nervously to 
each other. Often a heavy trench-mortar fired short 
and scattered us with its fountains of earth; and no one 
even bent his head. The roar of the battle had become 
so terrific that we were scarcely in our right senses. 
The nerves could register fear no longer. Every one 
was mad and beyond reckoning; we had gone over 
the edge of the world into superhuman perspectives. 
Death had lost its meaning and the will to live was 
made over to our country ; and hence every one was 
blind and regardless of his personal fate. 

Three minutes before the attack my batman, the 
faithful Vinke, beckoned to me, pointing to a full 
water-bottle. He recognized, in his own way, the 
need of the hour. I took a long pull. It was as 
though I drank water. There was only the cigar 
wanting, the usual one for such occasions. Three 
times the match was blown out by the commotion 
of the air. . . . 

The great moment had come. The fire lifted over 
the first trenches. We advanced. . . . 

The turmoil of our feelings was called forth by 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


*55 

rage, alcohol, and the thirst for blood as we stepped 
out, heavily and yet irresistibly, for the enemy’s lines. 
And therewith beat the pulse of heroism—the godlike 
and the bestial inextricably mingled. I was far in 
front of the company, followed by my batman and a 
man of one year’s service called Haake. In my right 
hand I gripped my revolver, in my left a bamboo 
riding>cane. I was boiling with a fury now utterly 
inconceivable to me. The overpowering desire to 
kill winged my feet. Rage squeezed bitter tears from 
my eyes. 

The tremendous force of destruction that bent over 
the field of battle was concentrated in our brains. 
So may men of the Renaissance have been locked in 
their passions, so may a Cellini have raged or were¬ 
wolves have howled and hunted through the night on 
the track of blood. We crossed a battered tangle of 
wire without difficulty and at a jump were over the 
front line, scarcely recognizable any longer. The 
attacking waves of infantry bobbed up and down in 
ghostly lines in the white rolling smoke. 

Against all expectation a machine-gun rattled at 
us from the second line. I and the men with me 
jumped for a shell-hole. A second later there was a 
frightful crack and I sank forward in a heap. Vinke 
caught me round the neck and turned me on my back : 
‘ Are you hit, sir ? ’ There was nothing to be seen. 
The one-year’s-service fellow had a hole through his 
arm, and assured us, groaning, that he had a bullet 
in his back. We pulled off his uniform and bound 
him up. The churned-up earth showed that a 
shrapnel shell had burst at the level of our faces on 



a S 6 the great offensive 

the edge of the shell-hole. It was a wonder we were 
still alive. 

Meanwhile the others were on beyond us. We 
scrambled after them, leaving the wounded man to 
his fate, after we had stuck a bit of wood in the ground 
near him with a strip of white muslin as a mark for 
the wave of stretcher-bearers that were following 
the fighting troops. Half-left of us the great railway 
embankment in the line Ecoust-Croisilles, which we 
had to cross, rose out of the mist. From loopholes 
and dugout windows built into the side of it rifles and 
machine-guns were rattling merrily. 

Even Vinke had disappeared. I followed a sunken 
road, with its smashed-in shelters yawning in its 
banks. I strode on in a fury over the black and 
torn-up ground, from which rose the suffocating gas 
of our shells. I was entirely alone. 

Then I caught sight of the first of the enemy. A 
figure crouched, wounded apparently, three metres 
in front of me in the middle of the pounded hollow 
of the road. I saw him start at the sight of me and 
stare at me with wide-open eyes as I walked slowly 
up to him holding out my revolver in front of me. A 
drama without an audience was ready. To me the 
mere sight of an enemy in tangible form was a release. 
Grinding my teeth, I pressed the muzzle to the temple 
of this wretch, whom terror now crippled, and with 
my other hand gripped hold of his tunic. With a 
beseeching cry he snatched a photograph from his 
pocket and held it before my eyes . . . himself, sur¬ 
rounded by a numerous family. . . . 

I forced down my mad rage and walked past. 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


257 

Men of my company came jumping down into the 
sunken road. We were aglow with heat. I pulled 
off my cloak and threw it away. I still remember 
that I shouted very emphatically and more than once : 
* Lieutenant Jiinger now casts off his cloak,’ and 
at that the Fusiliers laughed as though I had made 
the most priceless joke. Above us every one was 
going for it over the top without the least regard for 
the machine-guns, which were at the utmost four 
hundred metres away from us. The same impulse 
of annihilation drew me into the sheaves of fire. I 
ran straight for the embankment, spit bullets as it 
might. In a shell-hole I came upon a figure in a 
brown waterproof shooting with a revolver. It was 
Kius, who was in a like mood and stuffed a handful 
of cartridges in my pocket by way of greeting. 

We must have spent a long while running to and 
fro among the shell-holes and engaging one target 
after another. In any case I found myself at last at 
the foot of the embankment, and I saw a dugout 
window quite close to me covered with a sandbag, 
from which I could see they were firing. I shot through 
the cloth. A man near me tore it down and threw in 
a bomb. A shock and a cloud of smoke welling out 
showed the result. Two ran along the bank and 
dealt with the other loopholes in the same way. I 
raised my hand to warn the men behind, for their 
bullets at very short range were whistling past our 
ears. They nodded back delighted. After that we 
clambered with hundreds more at one rush up the 
bank. For the first time in the war I saw large bodies 
of men in hand-to-hand fighting. The English held 

R 



258 THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 

two terraced trenches on the rear slope. Shots were 
exchanged and bombs lobbed down at a range of a 
few metres. 

I jumped into the first trench. Stumbling round 
the first traverse I collided with an English officer 
with an open tunic and his tie hanging loose. I did 
without my revolver, and seizing him by the throat 
flung him against the sandbags, where he collapsed. 
Behind me the head of an old major appeared. He 
was shouting to me, * Shoot the hound dead.’ 

I left this to those behind me and turned to the 
lower trench. It seethed with English. I fired off 
my cartridges so fiercely that I pressed the trigger ten 
times at least after the last shot. A man next me 
threw bombs among them as they scrambled to get 
away. A dish-shaped helmet was sent spinning high 
in the air. 

A minute saw the battle ended. The English 
jumped out of their trenches and fled by battalions 
across the open. They stumbled over each other 
as they fled, and in a few seconds the ground was 
strewn with dead. Only a few got away. 

A N.C.O. was standing near me gaping at this 
spectacle with mouth agog. I snatched the rifle from 
his hands in an uncontrollable need to shoot. My 
first victim was an Englishman whom I shot between 
two Germans at 150 metres. He snapped together 
like the blade of a knife and lay still. 

After quite a time had been spent thus, we went 
on. The spirit of the attack had been kindled by 
success to a white heat of recklessness in every single 
man. There was no question of leading the several 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


259 

units. Nevertheless, one cry was on everybody’s lips: 
‘ On ! * Every man went straight ahead. 

As my objective I chose a little hill where the ruins 
of a cottage, the cross on a grave, and the wreckage 
of an aeroplane were to be seen. I went forward so 
blindly that I got into the zone of our own fire, and 
had to throw myself into a shell-hole for cover while 
waiting for the guns to lengthen their range. I found 
a young officer of another regiment close to me who, 
quite alone like myself, was rejoicing over the success 
of our first assault. The common enthusiasm brought 
us as close in those few moments as if we had known 
each other for years. The next spring forward parted 
us, never to meet again. 

Even during these frightful moments something 
ludicrous occurred. A man near me whipped his 
rifle to his shoulder as though he were out shooting, 
to shoot at a hare that suddenly jumped up and ran 
through our lines. The episode was so bewildering 
that I had to laugh. There can indeed be nothing 
so horrible that some crazy fellow cannot cap it. 

Near the ruins of the house lay a small length 
of trench which was being raked by machine-gun 
fire from the far side. I jumped in at one bound 
and found it unoccupied. Immediately after Kius 
and Wedelstadt appeared. An orderly of Wedelstadt’s, 
who came last, collapsed in mid-jump and lay dead, 
shot through the eye. When Wedelstadt saw this 
last man of his company fall headlong he leant his 
head on the edge of the trench and wept. And 
neither was he destined to survive this day. 

Below us lay a strongly-held position in a sunken 



260 the great offensive 

road. In front of it were two machine-gun nests, 
one on each edge of a hollow. The turmoil of our 
gunfire had rolled on over this strong-point and the 
enemy seemed to have recovered. At any rate he 
was pouring out lead as fast as it would leave the 
barrels. We were separated by a strip of ground 
five hundred metres wide, and across it the sheaves of 
fire buzzed like swarms of bees. 

After a pause for breath we went on over the top at 
the enemy with a handful of men. It was a fight to 
the death. After one or two springs forward I lay 
opposite the left-hand machine-gun position, alone 
but for one man. I could clearly distinguish a 
flat helmet behind a low mound of earth, and close 
beside it a thin spiral of steam. I approached in 
quite short springs so as to allow no chance for aim. 
Each time that I lay down the man threw me a clip 
of cartridges and I fired a few carefully-aimed shots. 
* Cartridges , . cartridges ! 9 I turned round and 
saw him lying twitching on one side. 

When I look back now to that blind dash across the 
open against a choice and well-furnished position, 
I see that we must have been inspired by a quite 
improbable degree of recklessness. And yet, where 
would be the success of war if it were not for individuals 
whom the thrill of action intoxicates and hurls forward 
with an impetus not to be resisted ? It seemed often 
as though death itself feared to cross our path. From 
the left, where the resistance was weaker,there appeared 
a few men who were almost in a position to bomb the 
post. I set out on my last spring forward and stumbled 
over a barbed-wire entanglement into the trench. 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


261 


The English left their guns and ran, fired on from all 
sides, and made their escape to the nest on the right. 
The machine-gun was half concealed beneath a huge 
heap of empty drums. It was still nearly red-hot 
and smoking. The corpse of an athlete lay in front 
of it. A shot through the head had put out one eye, 
and I could claim the shot as mine. The enormous 
fellow with his great white eyeball and his smoke- 
blackened skull looked terrible. I was perishing of 
thirst and, unable to bear it any longer, I began to look 
for water. The entrance of a deep dugout seemed 
promising. I peered in and saw a man sitting at 
the bottom mending an ammunition belt on his knee. 
Instead of going for him at once, as in prudence I ought, 
I called out to him : ‘ Come here 1 hands up! ’ He 
jumped up staring at me in amazement, and dis¬ 
appeared in the darkness. I threw a bomb after 
him. Presumably the dugout had a second entrance, 
for a man came from behind a traverse and said 
laconically: ‘ We’ve just shot them. They ’re done 
for.’ 

At last I came to a tin can full of cooling-water. 
I poured the oily fluid down in huge gulps, filled an 
English water-bottle, and gave some to the others 
who suddenly crowded into the trench. 

Meanwhile, from the right-hand machine-gun nest 
and also from the sunken road, sixty metres in front 
of us, there was still a resolute resistance. The fellows 
put up a superb show. We tried to turn the English 
machine-gun on them, but we had no success with it. 
On the contrary, while I was busy with it a bullet 
flew by my head, grazed a Jager lieutenant stand- 



262 


THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


ing behind me, and wounded a man severely in the 
shoulder. A light machine-gun section had better 
luck. They got their gun mounted on the edge of our 
little crescent-shaped trench and raked the English 
from the flank. 

There was a moment of surprise, and it was turned 
to good account by the assaulting troops on our right. 
They charged the sunken road from the front, with 
our 9th Company, still intact, led by Lieutenant 
Gipkens, at the head. And now from every shell- 
hole figures rose, and with a terrific hurrah, brandish¬ 
ing their rifles, rolling their eyes, foam on their lips, 
they rushed upon the enemy’s position, out of which 
the defenders advanced by hundreds with their 
hands held high. 

No quarter was given. The English hastened with 
upstretched arms through the first wave of storm troops 
to the rear, where the fury of the battle had not reached 
boiling point. An orderly of Gipkens’ shot a good 
dozen or more of them with his 32 repeater. 

I cannot blame our men for their bloodthirsty 
conduct. To kill a defenceless man is a baseness. 
Nothing in the war was more repulsive to me than 
those heroes of the mess tables who used to repeat 
with a fat laugh the familiar tale of the prisoners 
marched in : c Did you hear that about the massacre ? 
Priceless ! ’ 

On the other hand, the defending force, after 
driving their bullets into the attacking one at five paces’ 
distance, must take the consequences. A man cannot 
change his feelings again during the last rush with a 
veil of blood before his eyes. He does not want to 




THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 263 

take prisoners but to kill. He has no scruples 
left; only the spell of primeval instinct remains. 
It is not till blood has flowed that the mist 
gives way in his soul. He looks round him as 
though waking from the bondage of a dream. It is 
only then that he becomes once more a soldier of 
to-day and capable of addressing himself to the 
next problem of tactics. 

This was the state we found ourselves in after 
the capture of the sunken road. A large body of 
the men had collected and stood in a mob, shouting 
confusedly. Some officers pointed out to them the 
continuation of the hollow ground, and the great battle 
horde with astonishing coolness lumbered on. 

The hollow ran up into higher ground, and from 
there enemy columns were coming into sight. We ad¬ 
vanced, now and then standing still to shoot, till we were 
held up by heavy rifle-fire. It was extremely painful 
to hear the bullets striking the ground near your head. 
Kius, who had come up again, picked up a flattened 
one that had been stopped half a metre in front of 
his nose. Making use of a brief pause, we got to a 
shell-hole. They had already become rare. We found 
a number of officers of our battalion there. It was 
commanded now by Lieutenant Lindenburg; for 
Baron von Solemacher had unfortunately been mortally 
wounded during the assault on the embankment. 
On the right side of the hollow, Lieutenant Breyer, 
attached to us from the 10th Jagers, was strolling 
along through the machine-gun fire, to the delight 
of every one, with a walking-stick in his hand and a 
long green huntsman's pipe in his mouth, and his 



264 THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 

rifle hung on his shoulder as if he were out shooting 
hares. 

We told each other briefly our adventures so far, 
and handed round water-bottles and chocolate, and 
then the general wish was to go on again. The 
machine-guns, threatened apparently on the flank, had 
disappeared. We might perhaps have won three or 
four kilometres. The hollow was seething with the 
attacking troops. As far as the eye could see behind 
us there were men coming on in open order, ranks 
and columns. 

We were unfortunately much too thick on the 
ground, and it was just as well we did not know in 
the heat of the attack how many were left behind, 
either dead or wounded. 

We reached the high ground without opposition. 
A few khaki figures jumped from a piece of trench on 
our right, and we shot them down out of hand as they 
ran. Most of them were accounted for. The top 
of the hill was held by a row of dugouts. From some 
of them smoke was rising, and of these we made short 
work with bombs. From others the occupants 
emerged with arms uplifted and knocking knees. 
Water-bottles and cigarettes were taken from them, 
and as soon as the way to the rear was pointed out they 
hurried off with great speed. One young Englishman 
had already surrendered to me, and then suddenly 
turning round he disappeared again into his dugout. 
As he stayed in concealment in spite of my summons 
to come out, we made an end of his indecision with 
a bomb and went on. A narrow footpath went off 
down to the other side of the hill. A signpost showed 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 265 

that it led to Vraucourt. While the others still 
delayed in the dugouts, Heins and I went over the 
top of the hill. 

Down below lay the ruins of Vraucourt. The 
Sashes of a battery in action were to be seen in front, 
but the detachments Sed into the village at the sight 
of the first wave of storm troops. The occupants, 
too, of a number of dugouts built in the sides of a 
sunken road rushed out and Bed. I shot one of them 
as he jumped out of the entrance of the nearest. 

With two men of the company who had reported 
to me meanwhile I went along the sunken road. 
There was a defended position to the right of it from 
which came a heavy fire. So we withdrew into the first 
dugout, over which very soon the shots of both sides 
were crossing. My Englishman lay in front of it, a 
mere lad. I had shot him right through the head. 
It is a strange feeling to look into the eyes of a man 
whom you have killed with your own hands. 

We did not worry over the increasing fire, but 
established ourselves in the dugout and looked 
through the provisions left behind, as our stomachs 
reminded us that we had eaten nothing during the 
attack. We found here white bread, jam, and a stone 
jar full of ginger-beer. After refreshing myself I sat 
on an empty biscuit-tin and read some English news¬ 
papers that abounded in the most tasteless invective 
against the * Huns.’ After a while we became tired 
of doing nothing, so we went back to the beginning 
of the sunken road in jumps, and there found a large 
body of men assembled. Thence we could see a 
battalion of the 164th near Vraucourt. We decided 



266 


THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


to storm the village, and hurried forward again along 
the sunken road. A little way before the edge of 
the village we were brought to a stop by our own 
artillery, which had the stupidity to go on shooting 
at the same spot till next day. A heavy shell landed 
among us when we were half-way and killed four men. 
The others turned and ran. 

As I learned later, the artillery had orders to go 
on shooting at their longest range. This incompre¬ 
hensible order took the finest fruits of victory from 
our grasp. Grinding our teeth with rage, we had to 
make a halt before the wall of fire. 

In the hope of finding a gap in it we turned away 
to the right, where at that moment a company com¬ 
mander of the 76th was leading an attack on the 
Vraucourt line. We joined in with a cheer, but had 
scarcely got a footing in it before our own artillery 
shelled us out again. We stormed the trench three 
times, and three times had to retire again. Curse 
as we might, we could only occupy some shell-holes, 
and there a grass fire started by our artillery destroyed 
many wounded and caused us intolerable discomfort. 
The English rifle-fire, too, caused casualties, among 
whom was the volunteer, Grutzmacher, of my company. 

Darkness came slowly on. Sporadically the rifle- 
fire blazed out in a final burst and then was silent all 
along our front. The men, utterly exhausted, looked 
round for shelter for the night, and the officers called 
their own names without ceasing in order to assemble 
the scattered companies. 

Twelve men of the 7th Company had collected 
round me during the last hour. As it was growing 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


267 

cold I led them to the little dugout in front of which 
my Englishman lay, and sent them out to collect 
blankets and cloaks from the fallen. When I got them 
all settled down I could no longer resist the curiosity 
I had to visit the gun-pit lying in front of us. I took 
Fusilier Haller with me, as I had the utmost confidence 
in his sporting spirit. We walked on with our rifles at 
the ready towards the pit, over which our artillery fire 
raged without ceasing, and next explored a dugout 
that had apparently been recently abandoned by 
English artillery officers. There was an enormous 
gramophone on the table that Haller at once set going. 
The gay musical-comedy song that whirred from the 
disc made a ghostly impression, and I threw the box 
to the ground, where after a wheeze and a gasp it lay 
still. The dugout was furnished with extreme com¬ 
fort, even to a little open grate and a mantelpiece, on 
which lay pipes and tobacco, with a circle of armchairs 
round the fire. Merry old England 1 

Naturally, we took without compunction whatever 
we liked. I chose a haversack, underclothes, a little 
silver flask full of whisky, a map-case, and some 
most charming toilet articles by Roger et Gallet, no 
doubt tender recollection of a Paris leave. 

A neighbouring room served as the kitchen, whose 
array of provisions filled us with respectful admiration. 
There was a whole boxful of fresh eggs. We sucked 
a large number on the spot, as we had long since for¬ 
gotten their very name. Against the walls were stacks 
of tinned meat, cases of priceless thick jam, bottles of 
coffee-essence as well, and quantities of tomatoes and 
onions ; in short, all that a gourmet could desire. 



268 THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 

This sight I often remembered later when we spent 
weeks together in the trenches on a rigid allowance 
of bread, washy soup, and thin jam. For four long 
years, in torn coats and worse fed than a Chinese 
coolie, the German soldier was hurried from one 
battlefield to the next to show his iron fist yet again 
to a foe many times his superior in numbers, well 
equipped and well fed. There could be no surer 
sign of the might of the idea that drove us on. It 
is much to face death and to die in the moment of 
enthusiasm. To hunger and starve for one’s cause 
is more. . . . 

After this glimpse into the enemy’s domestic 
circumstances we left the dugout and went into 
the gun-pit, where we found that two brand-new 
guns had been abandoned. I took a lump of chalk 
and chalked up the number of my company. I may 
observe that the right of capture was very little re¬ 
spected by the troops that followed after. Each unit 
obliterated the mark of its predecessor and put its 
own, till that of some labour battalion survived. This 
shows how very rudimentary the sporting instinct is 
among the people. 

We returned to the others, as our own guns were 
throwing metal about our ears all the time. Our 
front line, dug in the meanwhile by the troops behind 
us, was two hundred metres in our rear. I posted 
two men in front of the dugout and gave orders 
for the others of the guard to keep hold of their rifles. 
After I had arranged the reliefs, had a little more to 
eat, and made a note of the events of the day, I went 
to sleep. 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 269 

At 1 we were awakened by shouts and lively 
rifle-fire on our right. We seized our rifles and, 
rushing outside, posted ourselves in a large shell- 
hole. A few scattered Germans came back from in 
front of us and were fired on from our own lines. 
Two of them fell. Put on our guard by this, we 
waited till the excitement subsided behind us and, 
calling out to show who we were, we retired to our 
own lines. There we found the commander of the 
2nd Company, speechless with a cold and wounded 
in the arm, with about sixty men of our regiment. 
As he had to go back to a dressing-station, I took 
command of his detachment, among which were three 
ofEcers. Besides this there were the two companiea 
of Gipkens and Vorbeck, jumbled up like the rest. 

The commanding officer of the battalion waa 
Captain Baron von Ledebur; and of the regiment, 
Major Dietlein, as Major von Bardeleben had been 
wounded early in the day. 

I spent the rest of the night with some N.C.Os. 
of the 2nd Company in a little hole in the ground, 
where we were stiff with cold. I breakfasted in the 
morning from the plundered provisions, and sent a 
party to Queant to fetch coffee and rations. Our 
own artillery began again with its cursed shelling, and, 
as a morning greeting, sent us a direct hit in a shell- 
hole which accommodated four men of the machine- 
gun company. 

At dawn a platoon commander of my company, 
Vice-sergeant-major Kumpart, turned up with a few 
men. I had scarcely got my circulation going again 
after the cold of the night when I had orders to storm 



270 THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 

the Vraucourt line further to the right, taking with 
me what there was of the 76th Regiment as well. 
This line on our front was already partly in our 
hands. There was a thick morning mist as we moved 
off to the jumping-off position, a hill to the south of 
Ecoust, where many dead of the day before were 
lying. As is usual when the orders for an attack 
are somewhat vague, there was a tremendous palaver 
among the officers of the storm troops, which nothing 
but the play of an enemy machine-gun was able to 
bring to an end. Everybody jumped for the nearest 
shell-hole with the exception of the sergeant-major, 
Kumpart, who lay groaning. I hurried to him with 
a stretcher-bearer and bound him up. He was 
badly wounded in the knee. We extracted several 
pieces of bone from the wound with a forceps. He 
died a few days later. I felt it particularly, as he 
had been my drill-instructor three years before in 
Recouvrence. 

I exposed the folly of a frontal attack in a dis¬ 
cussion with Captain von Ledebur, since it was 
clear that the Vraucourt line, already partly in our 
hands, could with far less loss be rolled up from the 
left. We decided not to carry out the attack, and 
events proved us right. 

Such episodes prove the futility of the system of 
higher command with its headquarters far in the 
rear, though of course I do not question the necessity. 
At the same time such orders show clearly a lack 
of experience of front-line fighting. The time for 
frontal attacks without preparation has for ever gone 
by. The common soldier who has been taught his 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


271 

lesson by the enemy’s rifles could not fall into such 
a blunder. It succeeded only where the enemy was 
weak. The strong parts of the line then fell of 
themselves. 

For the time being we established ourselves in 
the shell-holes on the high ground. The sun came 
through by degrees and English aeroplanes appeared, 
which sprayed our refuges with machine-guns, but 
were soon driven off. Below Ecoust we saw a 
battery drive up, an unusual sight for old trench- 
soldiers. It, too, was soon shelled. One horse only 
tore itself free and galloped over the field. It was 
an uncanny sight—this panic-stricken beast against 
the wide and deserted stretches of country hung with 
the drifting smoke of the bursting shells. The 
enemy fliers had not been long gone before we began 
to be shelled. At first a few shrapnel broke over us, 
then light and heavy shells in plenty. We lay as 
though on a silver salver. Several unquiet spirits 
drew worse fire by losing their heads and running 
to and fro instead of lying low in their shell-holes and 
letting the stuff sweep over their heads. In such 
situations one must be a fatalist. I took this text to 
heart as I consumed the really glorious contents of 
a tin of gooseberry jam that I had carried off as 
booty. In this fashion the morning slowly drew to 
an end. 

We had observed movement for some time past 
on our left in the Vraucourt line. Now we saw 
straight in front of us the curved flight and the white 
bursts of German stick-bombs. This was the moment 
we waited for. 



272 THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 

I gave the word to advance. We reached the 
enemy line without encountering much fire, and 
jumped in, eagerly welcomed by a storm troop of 
the 76th Regiment. Headway was slowly made 
bombing along the trench, as at Cambrai. The 
enemy artillery soon found out, unfortunately, that 
we were obstinately eating into their lines. We were 
pretty sharply shelled with shrapnel and light shells, 
but the reserves who were streaming up to the trench 
over the open caught the worst of it. We did our 
utmost to clear the trench of the enemy so that we 
could take cover from the artillery fire. 

The Vraucourt line was still in course of digging, 
and many stretches of it were only marked out by 
the removal of the turf. When we rushed these 
pieces, we had all the fire in the neighbourhood 
concentrated on us. In the same way we had the 
enemy under our fire when they crossed these spots 
as they gave way before us, so that these short stretches 
of ground were soon heaped with corpses. It was 
a nerve-scourging spot. We dashed over the still 
warm muscular bodies, displaying powerful knees 
below their kilts, or crept on over them. They 
were Highlanders, and the resistance we were meeting 
showed that we had no cowards in front of us. 

After we had gained a few hundred metres in this 
fashion we were brought to a halt by the bombs and 
rifle-grenades that fell more and more thickly. The 
men began to give way. 

* Tommy’s counter-attacking ! 9 

* Bliew stahn ! 9 

‘ I ’ll just see that we ’re in touch.’ 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


273 


‘ Bombs forward ! Bombs forward ! ’ 

‘ Look out, sir ! ’ 

It is just in trench fighting, the fiercest fighting 
of all, that such recoils are most frequent. The 
bravest push to the front shooting and bomb-throw¬ 
ing. The rest follow on their heels automatically, in 
a herd. In the hand-to-hand battle the fighters jump 
back and forward, and in avoiding the murderous 
bombs of the enemy they run back on those behind 
them. Only those in the forefront know what the 
situation is, while further back a wild panic breaks out 
in the crowded trench. Perhaps a few even jump 
over the top and get shot, whereat the enemy of course 
are much encouraged. Indeed, if they seize their 
opportunity all is lost; and it is now for the officer 
to show that he is worth his salt, though he too may 
have the wind up. 

I succeeded in getting together a handful of men, 
and with them I organized a nucleus of resistance 
behind a broad traverse. We exchanged missiles 
with an invisible opponent at a few metres’ distance. 
It took some courage to hold your head up when 
they burst and whipped up the heaped soil of the 
traverse. A man of the 76th, close to me, shot 
off cartridge after cartridge, looking perfectly wild 
and without a thought of cover, till he collapsed in 
streams of blood. A shot had smashed his forehead 
with a report like a breaking board. He doubled 
up in his comer of the trench, and there he remained 
in a crouching attitude, his head leaning against 
the side. His blood poured on to the ground as 
though poured out of a bucket. The snorting death- 

s 



274 THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 

rattles sounded at longer intervals and at last ceased. 
I seized his rifle and went on firing. At last there 
was a brief pause. Two men who were in front 
even of us made an attempt to dash back over the 
top. One fell into the trench shot through the 
head. The other, shot through the body, could only 
creep after him. 

We sat in the bottom of the trench and waited and 
smoked English cigarettes. Now and then a well- 
aimed rifle-grenade came arrowing over. The man 
shot in the belly was a young lad, and he lay between 
us and almost contentedly stretched himself like a cat 
in the warm rays of the setting sun. He slipped 
over to death smiling like a child. 

It was a sight that had nothing sad or painful in 
it. I was touched by nothing but a clear feeling of 
affection for the dying man. The groaning, too, of 
his comrade gradually ceased. He died where he 
lay, after fits of shuddering. 

We tried several times to work our way forward 
by crawling flattened out over the bodies of the 
Highlanders across the undug part, but we were 
driven back each time by machine-gun fire and 
rifle-grenades. Every casualty I saw was a fatal one. 
In this way the forward part of our trench was gradu¬ 
ally filled with dead ; and in turn we were constantly 
reinforced from the rear. Soon there was a light 
or a heavy machine-gun behind every traverse. I 
stood behind one of these lead squirts and shot till 
my forefinger was blackened with smoke. When 
the cooling-water had evaporated, the tins were 
handed round and to the accompaniment of not 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 275 

very polite jokes and by a very simple expedient filled 
up again : 

In anxious moments we must bring 
Ourselves to much that *s not the thing. 

The sun was far down in the sky. It seemed that 
the second day of battle was over. For the first time 
I took a careful look round and sent back a report 
and sketch-map, overtaken once more by the thought: 

* You are not a fighter only, but a soldier! • The 
trench we were in cut the Vraucourt-Mory road 
at a distance of five hundred metres in front of us. 
The road was camouflaged by hangings fastened to 
the trees. Enemy troops were hurrying over the 
slope of a hill behind, shells bursting round them. 
Streamers of black and white and red crossed the 
cloudless blue of the evening sky. The beams of 
the sunset dipped them in a tender rosy red so that 
they resembled a flight of flamingoes. We unfolded 
our trench-maps and spread them out to see how 
far we had penetrated the enemy lines. 

A cool evening breeze promised a sharp night. 
Wrapped in an English trench-coat I leaned against 
the side of the trench and talked to little Schultz, 
the comrade of my Indian patrols, who, like a good 
friend, had turned up with four heavy machine- 
guns just where there was most need for them. Men 
of all companies sat on the fire-steps. Their features 
were youthful and clear-cut beneath their steel helmets. 
Their leaders had fallen and it was of their own 
impulse that they were here and in their right place. 
We set about putting ourselves in a state of defence 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


276 

for the night. I put my revolver and a dozen English 
bombs beside me and felt ready for all comers, even 
though they were the most pig-headed of Scotsmen. 

Then there came a new outbreak of bombing 
from the right, and on the left German light-signals 
went up. From somewhere a faint hurrah came on 
the wind. That roused us. ‘ They ’re surrounded ! 
They ’re surrounded ! ’ In one of these moments of 
enthusiasm that herald great exploits, every one seized 
his rifle and rushed forward along the trench. After 
a short encounter with bombs a body of Highlanders 
made hurriedly for the road. There was no holding 
us now. In spite of warning shouts, 4 Look out, 
the machine-gun on the left is still firing ! ’ we jumped 
out of the trench and in an instant reached the road, 
where there was a stampede of Highlanders. A long, 
thick wire entanglement cut off their retreat, so that 
like hunted game they had to run past us at fifty 
metres’ distance. On our side there broke out a 
tumultuous hurrah that must have struck their ears 
like the trump of the last judgment, and a hurricane 
of rapid fire. Machine-guns mounted in haste made 
a massacre of it. 

While I was cursing at a jam that prevented me 
firing, I felt a blow on the shoulder. I turned round 
and saw the face of little Schultz, distorted with rage. 
‘ Look . . . they ? re still firing, the cursed swine ! ’ 
I looked where he pointed and saw a row of men 
in a little trench across the road, some loading, some 
shooting. In a moment, though, the first bombs 
were thrown from the right, and the whole trunk of 
one of them was flung into the air. 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


277 

Reason bade me stay where I was while we finished 
off the enemy at our leisure with a few rounds. In¬ 
stead of this I threw away my rifle and rushed with 
clenched fists on to the road between the two sides. 
Unluckily, I was still wearing the English coat and 
my cap with a red band. In the very transport of 
victory I felt a sharp blow on the left side of my breast. 
Night descended on me. I was finished ! 

I was convinced I was shot through the heart, yet 
I felt neither pain nor fear as I awaited my immediate 
death. When I found to my astonishment that I 
had not fallen, and discovered no hole in my shirt 
either, I turned on the enemy again. At that, a 
man of my company rushed up : 4 Sir, take off that 
coat! ’ and snatched the dangerous garment from 
my shoulders. 

Another hurrah rent the air. From the right, 
where ever since the morning bombing had been going 
on, a number of Germans sprang over the road to 
our help, with a young officer in a brown waterproof 
at their head. It was Kius. By good luck he 
tripped over a low entanglement just as our English 
machine-gun fired its last shots, and the stream of 
bullets flew by over his head. The Scottish were 
annihilated in a few furious moments by rifle-fire and 
bombs. The road was strewn with dead, and what few 
survived were followed by our fire. 

When I was standing talking to Kius in the cap¬ 
tured trench I felt a moist feeling on my breast. 
Tearing open my shirt I saw that I had been hit 
just over the heart. The bullet had gone through 
me just above my Iron Cross, leaving two holes 



278 THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 

in my body and two in my shirt. There was no 
doubt that I had been shot for an Englishman by one 
of our own men (I strongly suspected the one who 
had torn off my coat) at a range of a few paces. 

Kius bound me up and with great difficulty in¬ 
duced me to leave the battlefield at this interesting 
moment. We parted with ‘ See you in Hanover ! * 

I chose myself an escort, looked for my map- 
case (it contained my diary) on the fire-swept road, 
and went back through the trench that we had fought 
our way along. 

Our battle-cries had been so powerful that the 
enemy artillery had broken out at once. Over all 
the ground beyond the trench, and particularly on 
the trench itself, lay a barrage of unusual intensity. 
It was scarcely likely we could get safely through 
it. We went in jumps from traverse to traverse. 
Suddenly there was a shattering crash on the edge 
of the trench close by me. I felt a blow on the 
back of the head and fell forward stunned. When 
I came to, I was hanging with my head down over 
the breech of a heavy machine-gun and staring into 
a pool of blood that grew larger at an alarming 
rate. The blood poured so fast that I gave up all 
hope of survival. As my escort, however, assured 
me that nothing of my brain was to be seen, I picked 
myself up and went on. I had paid the penalty 
now for my folly in going into an attack without 
a helmet. 

In spite of the double loss of blood I was in great 
excitement and implored every one we met in the 
trench, as though possessed by one idea, to hurry 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 279 

forward and join in the fight. We were soon beyond 
the zone of the light field-guns and slackened our 
pace, as only a bird of ill-omen need expect to be 
hit by an isolated heavy. 

In the sunken road leading from Noreuil I passed 
Brigade headquarters, and reported to Major-General 
Hobel, whom I had already informed of our success, 
and begged him to send reserves to support the 
attacking force. The general told me that I had been 
reported killed the day before. It was not the first 
time in the war. 

In Noreuil a great pile of boxes of bombs was 
burning merrily by the roadside. We hurried past 
with very mixed feelings. Beyond the village I got 
a lift in an empty ammunition waggon. I had a 
sharp encounter with the officer commanding the 
ammunition column, who wanted to have two wounded 
Englishmen who had helped me along over the last 
part of the way thrown out of the waggon. 

The traffic on the Noreuil-Qu&nt road was amazing. 
No one who has not seen it can form any idea of the 
endless columns of troops that go to make an offensive. 
Beyond Queant the throng was incredible. It was 
a sad sight when I passed the little cottage of Jeanne 
d’Arc. Nothing but the foundation was left. I went 
up to an officer with a white arm-band, denoting 
that he was in control of the traffic, and he procured 
me a seat in a private car as far as the field-hospital 
at Souchy-Couchy. We often had to wait half an 
hour when waggons and lorries got mixed up and 
blocked the road. The doctors in the operating 
theatre of the field-hospital were feverishly busy. 



THE GREAT OFFENSIVE 


280 

Nevertheless, the surgeon who attended me could not 
repress his astonishment at the fortunate nature of my 
wounds. Even the bullet that had passed in and out 
of the back of my head had not injured the skull. 

After an excellent sleep I was sent next morning 
to the casualty clearing-station at Cantin, where I had 
the luck to meet Lieutenant Sprenger, whom I had 
never seen again after we went over the top. He 
had had a rifle-bullet through the thigh. 

After a short stay in the Bavarian Field Hospital 14 
(Montigny) we were conveyed to Douai and there 
put into a hospital train for Berlin. There, after 
fourteen days’ nursing, my wounds healed up again as 
well as their five predecessors had done. 

To my sorrow I heard in Hanover that little Schultz, 
among many others I had known, had fallen during 
the hand-to-hand fighting. Kius had come out of 
it with a harmless abdominal wound. Any one who 
saw us celebrating our meeting in a little Hanover 
bar would hardly have believed we had parted only 
fourteen days before to other music than the peaceful 
click of billiard balls. 



ENGLISH GAINS 


O N the 4th of June 1918 I joined the regiment 
again. It was out on rest at Vraucourt, now 
far behind the line. The new commanding 
officer, Major von Luttichau, gave me the command 
of my old 7th company. 

As I drew near my quarters the men ran to meet me 
and, taking my things from me, led me in in triumph. 
It was like coming back to a family circle. 

We occupied a number of corrugated-iron huts 
in the middle of neglected grass fields whose green 
was lit up with sheets of yellow flowers. This waste 
ground, that we had christened ' Die Wallachei/ was 
grazed by herds of horses. If you went out of the 
hut you experienced the disquieting sense of empty 
spaces that sometimes grips the cowboy, the Bedouin, 
and every other dweller of the waste. We went long 
walks in the evenings in the country round, and looked 
out for partridges, or for war material hidden in the 
grass. One afternoon I rode to the sunken road 
near Vraucourt where there had been such hard 
fighting two months before. It was thickly edged 
with crosses, among which I found many a well- 
known name. 

Soon the regiment was put into the line in front of 
Puisieux-au-Mont. We were conveyed by night on 
lorries, when the cone of light from the parachute 
lights of night bombers showed up the road as a 
strip of white in the darkness. Near or far the rushing 

111

swirl of the descending bomb was swallowed in 
reverberations as it burst. Then the searchlight's 
quivering arm probed the dark sky for the treacherous 
night-hawk, shrapnel burst in a scintillating spray, 
and tracer-shells chased each other in a long chain 
like fiery wolves. 

A repulsive scent of corpses hung about this con¬ 
quered ground. Whether strong or almost impercept¬ 
ible, it acted on the nerves as an irritant and wrapped 
one in a mood of overstrung and eerie foreboding. 

‘ Offensive incense,' I heard a cynic and an old 
soldier say at my elbow, as we were passing for some 
minutes between rows of dimly-seen graves. 

From Achiet-le-Grand we marched along the 
embankment of the Bapaume railway line and cut 
across country into the line. The shelling was lively. 
Two shells of medium calibre fell close while we were 
making a brief halt. The memory of the unforgettable 
night of horror, March 19th, drove us onwards. 
Close behind the front line we came on a noisy company 
that had been relieved, and chance took us past them 
just as their mouths were stopped by a dozen or two 
of shrapnel. Heaping them with abuse, my men 
jumped head over heels into the next communication 
trench. Three were hit and had to go back to the 
field dressing-station. 

I was utterly exhausted when at three in the morning 
I reached my dugout. It was miserably small, and 
promised little for my comfort during the days ahead. 

A candle glowed red in the indescribable atmo¬ 
sphere. I stumbled over a tangle of legs and brought 
the hovel to life by the magic word ‘ Relief.' A

283 

string of curses proceeded from a hole like a baker’s 
oven, and then one by one emerged an unshaven 
face, a pair of battered shoulder-straps, a weather¬ 
beaten uniform, and two clods of earth in which 
presumably boots were concealed. We sat down at 
a so-called table and went through the business of 
handing over, in which each tried to do the other in to 
the tune of a dozen iron rations and a few Verey-light 
pistols. My predecessor was then disgorged into 
the open through the narrow entry, prophesying as 
he went that the rotten hole would not last out 
another three days. I remained inside—the new 
captain of Sector A. 

I surveyed our trench next morning and found 
little to cheer me. I had scarcely left the dugout 
when I met two coffee-carriers bleeding from 
wounds inflicted by shrapnel bullets in the com¬ 
munication trench. A few steps further Fusilier 
Ahrens reported to me with a hit from a ricochet. 

We had the village of Bucquoy in front of us and 
Puisieux-au-Mont behind. The company was with¬ 
out support in a front line that was both shallow 
and narrow, and we were separated from the 76th 
Infantry Regiment on our right by a large unoccupied 
gap. The left flank of the regimental front com¬ 
prised a piece of splintered woodland, known as 
Wood 125. By orders, no deep dugouts were ex¬ 
cavated. The men were accommodated two at a time 
in little dugouts held up by so-called tin Siegfrieds. 

As my dugout was situated behind quite another 
part of our front, the next thing I did was to seek 
new quarters. A hut-like affair in a length of trench 



ENGLISH GAINS 


284 

that had fallen in seemed to me to meet the case 
when I had put it into a defensible state by collecting 
a few lethal instruments there. Once installed, I 
lived a hermit’s life among fields of green, disturbed 
only by an occasional runner or orderly, who carried 
the paper war even into this retired spot. 

One was able then to shake one’s head be¬ 
tween two shell-bursts over many matters of grave 
importance, such as that the town-major of X had 
lost a terrier with black spots, answering to the name 
of Zippi, if one had not lost oneself with savage 
humour in the suit for maintenance of the servant- 
girl Makeben against Corporal Meger. The pro 
formas and returns, too, provided us with needful 
distraction. One was kept so fully occupied with 
the inner organization that time was scarcely left 
over for the little affair of holding the line. And 
indeed one was asked little about it. It often 
appeared that collecting empty cartridge-cases was 
of far greater importance. Whenever the visit of a 
superior officer was announced I hurried along the 
trench collecting paper and cartridge-cases and in¬ 
structing the men on guard how they were to report 
themselves and click their heels together. Also that 
they were not to commit the crime of averting their 
eyes from the enemy in the course of the operation 
(though not even the tip of the enemy’s nose had 
been seen for three months past), nor even to let 
their rifles out of their hands. The sure reward was 
three days’ solitary confinement. 

These things were typical of us and did much 
harm. The letter stifled the spirit. The war was 



ENGLISH GAINS 


*8s 

bureaucratized. At the same time, the front-line 
officer had far too much discipline in his bones to 
raise these matters, though they were the object of 
curses in every platoon commander’s dugout. Yet it 
was for him to fuse the old Prussian spirit with the 
methods of modem warfare. 

To return to my dugout, to which I gave the fine 
name ‘ Wahnfried House.’ Its roof was my only 
worry; for it could only be described as relatively 
shell-proof—that is, only so long as it was not hit. 
However, I comforted myself with the thought that 
I was no worse off than the men. Every afternoon 
my batman put a blanket down in an immense shell- 
hole approached by a sap we had excavated, and there 
I had a sun-bath. My siesta was, I confess, fre¬ 
quently interrupted by the bursts of shells near-by 
or the whizz of bomb-splinters when we were bombed 
from the air. 

We were often heavily shelled at night. I lay on 
my bunk on a mattress of fresh grass and listened 
with a quite peculiar and a quite ungrounded sense 
of security to the shells falling around, while the soil 
descended in showers at each shock. Or else I went 
outside and looked from the fire-step across the sad 
night landscape, that was in such strange and in¬ 
describable contrast to the fiery spectacle whose 
dance-floor it was. 

At such moments there crept over me a mood I 
had never known before : a certain falling-off of the 
fighting spirit, a war-weariness occasioned by the 
length of time I had been exposed to the war’s excite¬ 
ments. Nothing but war and danger; not a night 



286 


ENGLISH GAINS 


that was not convulsed with shells. The seasons 
succeeded each other. Winter came and then summer, 
and one was always in the war. Tired of it and used 
to it, one was all the more dispirited and fed up with 
it just because one was used to it. One was blinded 
no longer by appearances. The war had raised deeper 
problems of its own. It was a singular time. 

The front line had comparatively little to suffer 
from the enemy fire. Otherwise it would have been 
untenable. It was Puisieux and the hollows near it 
that were chiefly and almost continuously shelled ; 
and in the evenings the bombardment rose to quite 
extraordinary intensity. Ration-parties and reliefs were 
consequently very risky matters. 

On the 14th of June I was relieved at two in the 
morning by Kius, who also had returned and was in 
command of the 2nd Company. We spent our time 
on rest behind the railway embankment at Achiet-le- 
Grand, which gave shelter to our huts and dugouts. 
The English shelled time after time with heavy 
low-trajectory shells. The quartermaster - sergeant 
of the 3rd Company, Rackebrand, fell a victim. A 
few days before this there had been an appalling 
disaster. A bomb had been dropped in the midst 
of the band of the 76th while a crowd stood round 
listening. There were many of the 73rd too among 
the casualties. 

There was a cluster of shell-shot tanks quite close 
to the embankment, and I often went to look at them. 
They bore names that were sometimes humorous, 
sometimes defiant, and sometimes affectionate, and 
they were camouflaged with paint; but they were all

in a pitiable plight. The little cabin of armoured plate, 
now shot to pieces, with its maze of pipes, rods, and 
wires, must have been an extremely uncomfortable 
crib during an attack, when the monsters, hoping 
to baffle the aim of our guns, took a tortuous course 
over the battlefield like gigantic helpless cockchafers. 
I thought more than once of the men in these fiery 
furnaces. 

On the morning of the 18th the 7th Company had 
to return to Puisieux on account of the uncertain 
state of affairs there, to be at the disposal of the 
C.O. of the troops in the line for carrying-parties or 
any other purpose. We occupied cellars and dugouts 
on the edge of the village nearest Bucquoy. Just 
as we arrived, a salvo of heavy shells went up in the 
surrounding gardens. In spite of this I did not 
refrain from breakfasting in a little arbour at the 
entrance of my dugout. After a while there was 
another of them ; so I made a dash for it. It went 
up quite close. A stretcher-bearer of my company 
named Kenziora, who was passing by with some 
dixies of water, was hit in the lower part of the 
body. As we bound him up, great drops of sweat 
stood on his forehead ; and when I tried to comfort 
him, he groaned out: ‘ It is a mortal wound. I 
can tell that well enough.’ In spite of this prophecy 
I shook him by the hand half a year later on our entry 
into Hanover. 

In the afternoon I took a solitary walk through 
Puisieux. The village had already been pounded to a 
heap of ruins by the Somme battle, and now shell- 
holes and wreckage of walls wore a mantle of green 



*88 


ENGLISH GAINS 


from which the white disks of the ruin-loving elder 
shone out on every side. Numerous more recent 
bursts had made rents in this mantle and once more 
laid bare the soil of the gardens, so often churned up 
already. 

The village street was fringed with the refuse of 
the advance now come to a standstill. Shell-shot 
waggons, abandoned ammunition, the weapons of hand- 
to-hand fighting, skeletons of half-decayed horses, 
surrounded by the hum of myriads of flies, all told 
of the vanity of all things in the fight for life. The 
church that occupied the highest point in the village 
consisted of nothing now but a dreary heap of stones. 
While I picked a bunch of wonderful roses in a waste 
garden a few shells came to remind me of prudence 
in this dancing-place of death. 

After a few days we relieved the 9th Company 
in the line of resistance, about 500 metres behind the 
front line. Three of my men were wounded in the 
course of the relief. Captain von Ledebur was 
wounded in the foot next morning by a shrapnel 
bullet close to my dugout. Though far gone in con¬ 
sumption, he felt that fighting was his vocation. It 
was his fate to succumb to this slight wound. He 
died soon after in hospital. On the 28th, Sergeant 
Gruner, who was in charge of my ration-party, was 
hit by a shell-splinter. This was the ninth casualty 
in the company within a few days. 

After we had been a week in the front line we had 
again to occupy the line of resistance, since our relief 
battalion was pretty well disbanded owing to Spanish 
influenza. With us, too, several men reported sick

daily. Influenza was so severe in the neighbouring 
division, that an enemy flier dropped a pamphlet 
to say that the English would undertake the relief if 
the troops were not taken out soon. We heard, all the 
same, that the malady was spreading more and more 
on the other side too. With us the effects were worse 
owing to under-nourishment, and in addition we were 
kept in constant readiness for an attack, as Wood 125 
was being shelled incessantly with an intensity that 
boded no good. The 6th Company, who were in the 
line there, were many of them down with carbonic- 
oxide poisoning. Some were only saved by an oxygen 
apparatus. 

One afternoon while walking along the trench I 
found several buried cases of English ammunition, 
and blew off the tip of my right forefinger through 
foolishly taking a rifle-grenade to pieces. The 
same evening, while I stood talking to Lieutenant 
Sprenger on the top of my dugout, a heavy shell 
went up close to us. We argued over the distance 
it was from us, and Sprenger estimated it at 10 metres, 
I at 30. In order to see how far I could rely on 
myself in such matters, I measured it and found 
the shell-hole 22 metres away from where we were 
standing. People are very apt to underestimate 
distances. 

On the 20th of July I was again with my company 
at Puisieux. I spent the whole afternoon standing 
on the ruins of a wall and watching the front line, 
where, it seemed to me, something very suspicious 
was going on. 

Wood 125 was often veiled in the smoke of violent 
T 



ENGLISH GAINS 


290 

shelling, while green and red lights were rising and 
falling. Often the artillery fire was silent, and then 
the tac-tac-tac of a machine-gun could be heard and 
the faint reports of distant bombing. 

From where I stood the whole thing was like a 
pretty game. It had not the majesty of the first- 
class battle, and yet the relentless strife between two 
brazen forces was there to see. 

All over the empty expanse there were hidden 
eyes fixed on the little wood, round whose shudder¬ 
ing oak tops fountains of brown earth danced in 
ever-changing figures. All round, distributed in 
trenches, shell-holes, caverns, and ruins, were men 
and guns, awaiting their turn in the battle for a piece 
of ground covered with splintered trunks. 

Far behind, at opposite poles, two generals are 
seated at tables spread with maps. There is a report, 
a brief exposition, a few words to a staff officer, a 
conversation on the telephone. An hour later a fresh 
bombardment tears up the old shell-holes and a fresh 
hecatomb of men bleeds in the suffocating fumes. . . . 

Towards evening I was summoned to the head¬ 
quarters of the troops in reserve, and there learned that 
the enemy had got a footing on the left flank of our 
trench system. In order to make a little room in front 
of us again, the order was that Lieutenant Petersen 
with the storm company was to clear the hedge trench 
that ran along the side of the wood, and I with my 
fellows the communication trench running parallel 
to it in a hollow of the ground. We moved off at 
dawn, but before we left our jumping-off place the 
rifle-fire became so violent that we abandoned the 



ENGLISH GAINS 


291 


enterprise for the time. I gave orders to occupy the 
Elbinger Alley, and made up for my broken night’s 
sleep in an immense cavern of a dugout. At 11 in 
the morning I was awakened by the noise of bombs 
from the left flank, where we held a block. I hurried 
to the spot and found the usual scene in this de¬ 
scription of fighting. White clouds of bomb-smoke 
hanging over the trench and a few traverses back, 
a machine-gun rattling from either side, while in be¬ 
tween there were men bending forward and jumping 
now forward, now back. The little coup de main was 
already beaten off, but it had cost one man, who lay 
behind the block, torn by bomb-splinters. 

Towards evening I had orders to lead the company 
back to Puisieux, and then, on arrival, I was ordered 
to take two sections and join in rolling up the 
trench in the hollow. At 3.40 we—that is to 
say, Lieutenant Voigt of the storm company with 
a storm troop, and I with my two sections — set 
off for the starting-point. Our instructions were 
to roll up the trench from the red point K to red 
point Z after a five minutes’ artillery and trench- 
mortar preparation. 

I cannot deny that both of us considered the artillery 
preparation, and in fact the taking and occupying 
of the trench, as unnecessary and ill-judged. The 
trench lay in the bottom of the hollow and was over¬ 
looked from all sides. The decisive point was the 
hedge trench: if an attack was to be made, it 
was essential to take it, and it automatically gave 
possession of the hollow. I cherished the firm 
suspicion that this operation had been ordered from 



ENGLISH GAINS 


292 

the rear and by the map, for it could not have occurred 
to any one who had seen the lie of the land to give 
such orders as these. 

After the artillery preparation—which cost us one 
man wounded—we advanced and rolled up the trench. 
Shortly before 2 we encountered opposition and 
bombed our way through it. As we had gained 
our objective and were not disposed for further 
fighting, we made a block and posted a section with 
a machine-gun behind it. 

The only pleasure I had in the affair was the be¬ 
haviour of the men of the storm troop, who reminded 
me forcibly of Grimmelhausen’s Simplicissimus. 
These young warriors with great shocks of hair and 
puttees fell into a hot dispute twenty metres from 
the enemy because one of them had called the 
other a rabbit. They cursed like troopers and 
vaunted themselves with mighty boasts. * Look 
here, we are not all such funks as you ! * one of 
them shouted at last, and rolled up fifty metres of 
trench by himself. 

By mid-day the section holding the block came 
back. They had had casualties and could hold out 
no longer. I had already given them up for lost, 
and was surprised that any one at all had been able 
to pass along this trench and still be alive. That 
is what comes of war on paper. 

In spite of our counter-attacks, the enemy still 
had a firm footing on the left flank of our front line 
and in the strongly barricaded communication trenches, 
and so threatened our support line. 

On the 24th of July I went to the new C sector 



ENGLISH GAINS 


293 


of the support line to find my way about, as I was 
to take it over on the next day. I got Lieutenant 
Gipkens, commanding the company, to show me 
the block at the hedge trench, and sat down beside 
him on a fire-step. Suddenly Gipkens seized hold 
of me and pulled me to one side. Next moment 
a shot flew into splinters on the very place where I 
had been sitting. By a lucky chance he had seen a 
rifle barrel slowly pushed forward out of a loophole 
in the block only forty metres from us. The keen 
eye of an artist had saved my life, for any fool could 
have hit me at that range. I was told later that 
three men of the 9th Company had already been 
shot through the head at this apparently harmless 
spot. In the afternoon I was tempted from my coal¬ 
hole by some not particularly violent artillery fire, 
though I was at the moment comfortably reading, over 
a cup of coffee. On the front there were signals for 
the barrage going up incessantly. Wounded men, 
limping back, told that the English had penetrated 
sectors B and C in the support line and occupied 
the ground in front of sector A. Immediately after 
came the bad news that Lieutenants Vorbeck and 
Grieshaber had fallen while defending their sectors, 
and that Lieutenant Kastner was badly wounded. 
At 8, too, Sprenger, till now in temporary command 
of the 5th Company, came to my dugout with 
a splinter in his back. After fortifying himself with 
a pull at the bottle, he went on to the dressing- 
station, quoting, ‘ Back now! Back now, Don 
Rodrigo ! ’ His friend Lieutenant Domeyer followed 
him, bleeding from the hand. 



ENGLISH GAINS 


294 

Next morning we relieved C sector, which had 
meanwhile been cleared of the enemy. There I found 
pioneers Boje and Kius with a detachment of the 
2nd Company, Gipkens with what remained of the 
9th. Eight dead Germans lay in the trench, and two 
English (cap badge : South Africa, Otago Rifles). All 
had been roughly handled by bombs. Their fearful 
injuries were written on their faces, distorted by 
anguish. Both eyes of two of them were shot away. 

While I was greeting Boje and Kius in our usual 
tone of ironical pessimism, I felt the look of horror 
in the eyes of a new recruit, a seminarist, who was 
gazing at me. Looking along the channel of his 
thoughts I had a shock when I realized for the first 
time how callous the war had made me. One got 
to regarding men as mere matter. 

I had men posted at the block and the trench cleared 
of the dead. At 11.45, without any warning having 
been given us, our artillery opened out on the position 
in front of us with the utmost fury. The result 
was more casualties for us than for the English, and 
it was not long before the tale of woe opened. The cry 
for stretchers came along the trench from the left. 
Hurrying along, I found what was left of my best 
platoon commander, a shapeless mass, in front of 
the block in the hedge trench. He had had a 
direct hit in the loins from one of our shells. The 
fragments of his uniform and clothing, torn from his 
body by the force of the explosion, were hanging 
above him on the splintered remnant of a thorn 
hedge. I had a ground-sheet thrown over him to 
spare the men the sight. Immediately after three 



ENGLISH GAINS 


295 

more men were wounded at the same spot. One of 
them had both hands severed at the wrist. He 
staggered to the rear, covered with blood, both arms 
resting on the shoulders of a stretcher-bearer. Lance- 
corporal Ehlers writhed on the ground, stupefied by 
the explosion. 

I sent protest after protest to headquarters, vigor¬ 
ously demanding either the cessation of the firing 
or the presence of artillery officers in the trench. 
Instead of any reply, a heavy trench-mortar joined 
in with the rest and made the trench an utter shambles. 
Blood and brains and pieces of flesh were every¬ 
where, and at once collected swarms of flies. At 
7.15 (1) I had orders, from which I learned that at 
7.30 the fire would be increased ; that at 8 two sections 
of the storm company were to rush the block in 
the hedge trench, to roll it up as far as red point A 
and then to get into touch on the right with a shock 
troop that was to make an attack parallel with theirs. 
Two sections of my company were to follow on and 
occupy the trench. 

I made the necessary arrangements with all speed 
while the artillery fire set in; detailed the two sections, 
and had a word with Lieutenant Voigt, who a few 
minutes later advanced as ordered. I took the matter 
more as an evening walk than anything else, and 
strolled along behind my two sections, wearing a 
cap, a stick-bomb under my arm. At the moment 
of the attack every rifle anywhere near was directed 
upon the hedge trench. With heads bent we made 
jumps from one traverse to the next. In front 
of us all went splendidly. The English fled to a 



ENGLISH GAINS 


296 

line behind, leaving one dead. I was bringing up 
the rear and had just passed the mouth of a trench 
branching off to the left, when the man ahead of me, 
a N.C.O., gave an excited shout and fired past my 
head to the left. As I could not at all explain his 
conduct to myself, I went a few steps back and found 
myself faced of a sudden by a powerfully-built English¬ 
man, just at the moment when he was lobbing a bomb 
after the flying N.C.O. At the same time shouts 
rose on all sides. They were coming on over the 
top to cut us off. I drew forth the bomb, my only 
weapon, and dropped it at the feet of the Tommy. 
Then I took to my heels in the direction of our lines. 
One man only, little Wilzek of my company, had 
the presence of mind to run after me. An egg-bomb 
was thrown after us, and tore his belt and the 
seat of his trousers without doing him any further 
injury. 

Voigt and the rest of the men who had gone the 
other way were apparently surrounded and done for. 
Continued shouts and explosions of bombs showed 
that they were selling their lives dearly. 

In the hope of coming to their help I led Fahnen- 
junker Mohrmann’s section forward along the hedge 
trench. However, we were brought to a stop by 
a hail of bursting Stokes bombs. A splinter flew 
against my chest and was caught on the clasp of 
my braces. Besides this, there was a sudden onset 
of artillery-lire. 

Fountains of earth were sprayed up out of coloured 
smoke ; the blare of flying metal screamed athwart 
the blunt roar of heavy shell-bursts ; the hum of 



ENGLISH GAINS 


297 

approaching shells came to an end with alarming 
suddenness; a cloud of splinters sang and whizzed 
about us. As an attack might be expected, I picked 
up a helmet and put it on and hurried back with a 
few men to the trench. 

Above we saw figures appearing, so we lay down 
on the edge of the trench and opened fire. Near 
me a new recruit was feverishly fingering the trigger 
of his machine-gun, without succeeding in getting 
a shot out of the barrel, till I snatched the thing out 
of his hands. A few English dropped. The rest 
disappeared in their trenches again, while the artillery 
fire grew ever more furious. As for our own—it took 
sides no longer. 

When I was walking to my crib, followed by an 
orderly, something struck the trench wall between us 
and, whipping my helmet off my head with enormous 
force, threw it far away. I thought I had got the 
whole charge of a shrapnel shell, and lay half-stunned 
in my fox-hole. A moment later a shell struck the 
verge of it and filled the small space with thick 
smoke. A long splinter smashed a box of gherkins 
at my feet. To prevent myself being buried I crept 
out into the trench again, and was able at least to 
rouse the two orderlies and my batman and put them 
on the look-out. 

It was a really unpleasant half-hour, and the com¬ 
pany had many losses. When the worst of it was 
over I went through the trench to take stock of the 
damage and ascertain what men I had left. As the 
count of fifteen men was not enough for holding 
the trench, I left the defence of the block to 



ENGLISH GAINS 


298 

Mohrmann and three men, and withdrew the remainder 
to a giant shell-hole behind our line and had all the 
available bombs collected there. My plan was to 
let the enemy, if they attacked, enter our trench 
unopposed and then at a signal blow them to bits 
from above. However, the battle confined itself to 
an incessant uproar of light trench-mortars, rifle- 
grenades, and bombs. 

On the 27th of July we were relieved by a company 
of the 164th Infantry Regiment. We were indeed 
utterly exhausted. The officer commanding the com¬ 
pany was seriously wounded while marching into 
the line; and a few days later my crib got a hit 
and buried his successor. We all breathed more 
freely when we had left Puisieux behind us and 
the rising storm of the final offensive that growled 
around it.

DIVISIONAL ORDERS OF THE DAY 

The 73rd Fusilier Regiment has added in the 
most brilliant fashion to its high reputation as a 
brave and war-tried unit in the severe fighting which 
was renewed against an enemy much superior in 
numbers. I am all the more glad to recognize this 
as I well know what high demands in endurance and 
loyalty to duty in our country’s cause must have 



ENGLISH GAINS

been made on the troops of the division during this 
long spell in the line on a difficult front. 

In particular, Lieutenant Jiinger earned fresh re¬ 
cognition. Already six times wounded, he was on 
this occasion, as always, a shining example to both 
officers and men.

MY LAST STORM 


O N the 30th July 1918 we went into rest at 
Sauchy Lestree, a delightful spot in Artois 
surrounded by water. A few days later we 
marched still further back to Escaudoeuvres, a small, 
smug working-men’s suburb of Cambrai. 

I occupied the typical best bedroom of an artisan’s 
house in northern France. The huge double bed 
as its ominous piece de resistance ; a fireplace with 
hideous red and blue glass vases on the mantelpiece ; 
a round table, chairs ; on the walls some of those 
frightful colour-prints of the Familistere , Vive la 
classe , souvenir de premiere communion , postcards, and 
other rubbish. I did what I could to give the right 
^ note to my arrival by throwing a pack of cards on the 
table and my riding-boots on the double bed. 

The clear moonlight nights favoured the visits of 
enemy bombers, who gave us a notion of the over¬ 
whelming superiority of material possessed by the 
other side. Night after night several formations came 
over and dropped their bombs of alarmingly high 
explosives over Cambrai and its suburbs. I was not 
agitated so much by the fine mosquito-like hum of 
the engines and the series of reverberating detona¬ 
tions as I was by the dash of my host for the cellar. 
It is true that, one day before my arrival, a bomb 
had landed in front of the windows and flung the 
gentleman of the house half-stunned out of the bed 

in which I slept, broken a bedpost, and bored the 
300 



MY LAST STORM 


3 d 

walls of the house with splinters. It was precisely 
this accident that lulled me into the belief that a 
repetition of it would be unlikely. 

After one day’s rest the detested but indispensable 
round of training set in once more. Drill, instruc¬ 
tion, roll-calls, lectures, and inspections filled a great 
part of the day. One entire morning was spent in 
pronouncing a verdict in a court of honour. 

Here, too, we were miserably fed. For a long 
while there was nothing for supper but gherkins, 
which the men very drily and aptly named ‘ gardener’s 
sausage.’ 

It was by no means easy to weld my decimated 
company into a unit again. It often went against 
the grain to be always insisting on the details of drill 
in my relations with the men, convinced though I was 
of the necessity. Drill as the means to an end is 
indispensable to every army. It cannot be replaced 
entirely by individual training nor by sporting in¬ 
stinct. A man, unless his inherent worth is beyond 
all doubt, must have obedience drilled into him* so 
that his natural instincts can be curbed by the spiritual 
compulsion of his commander even in the most awful 
moments. 

Above all, I devoted my efforts to the training 
of a shock troop, as it had become more and more 
clear to me in the course of the war that all success 
springs from individual action, while the mass of 
the troops give impetus and weight of fire. Better 
command a resolute section than a wavering company. 

I spent my leisure time reading, bathing, shooting, 
and riding. On my rides I found vast quantities of 



302 MY LAST STORM 

literature thrown down from aeroplanes. It was 
designed to hasten the moral deterioration of the 
army ; among it was even Schiller’s poem of Britannia 
the Free. It seemed to me very clever of the English 
to bombard us with poetry, and also very flattering 
to us. A war in which one fought with verses would 
indeed be a treat. The reward of thirty pfennigs 
set on the head of each copy by the military authorities 
showed that they did not undervalue the danger 
of this weapon. The cost of this, it is true, was laid 
upon the occupied territory. So it would appear 
we possessed no longer the wholly pure understanding 
of poetry. 

One afternoon I got a bicycle and rode into Cambrai. 
The dear old town was a desert. Shops and cafes 
were shut; the streets seemed dead in spite of the 
field-grey uniforms that thronged them. M. and 
Mme. Plancot, who had given me such a fine billet 
a year before, were delighted by my visit. They told 
me that conditions of life at Cambrai had got worse 
in every way. They complained particularly of the 
frequent visits the night bombers paid them. They 
often had to run downstairs and up again several 
times a night, disputing the point as they went whether 
it was better to die in the first cellar by the bomb itself 
or in the one lower by being buried alive. The old 
people’s careworn looks made me heartily sorry. A 
few weeks later, when the town was shelled, they 
had to leave the house, where they had spent their 
lives, at a moment’s notice. 

On the 23rd of August, I was alarmed by a violent 
knocking at my door at 11, when I had sunk into 



MY LAST STORM 


3 t >3 


a happy sleep. It was an orderly with marching 
orders. Already the day before the monotonous roll 
and stamp of unusually heavy artillery-fire had surged 
over and warned us on duty, at meals, at cards, to 
have no illusions about being on rest much longer. 
We had coined an expressive front-line expression 
for this distant thunder of guns : ' es wummert.’ 

We packed up in haste and were soon marching 
on the road to Cambrai in a storm like a cloud-burst. 
Our destination was Marquion, and we reached it 
at 5 in the morning. The quarters allotted to 
the company were a farmyard, surrounded by de¬ 
molished farm-buildings, in which each man found 
shelter as well as he could. I, with my one com¬ 
pany officer, Lieutenant Schrader, crept into a little 
dungeon of brick that had apparently, in more peace¬ 
ful times, been a goat-shed, but was now occupied 
only by several large rats. 

At mid-day there was an officers’ pow-wow, at 
which we heard that we were that night to take up 
a position in readiness on the right of the great Cambrai- 
Bapaume road, not far from Beugny. We were 
warned that an attack by the new swift and more easily 
manoeuvred tanks was probable. 

I paraded my company in battle order in a small 
orchard; and then, standing under an apple-tree, I said 
a few words to them as they stood round me in a horse¬ 
shoe. The expression on their faces was serious and 
manly. There was little to say. By this time there 
was not a man who did not know that we were on a 
precipitous descent, and the fact was accepted with 
an equanimity that only the moral force which in 



3^4 


MY LAST STORM 


every army accompanies its armed force can explain. 
Every man knew that victory could no longer be ours. 
But the enemy should know that he fought against 
men of honour. 

On such occasions I took care not to be carried 
away by a spirit of daredevilry. It would hardly 
have been appropriate to show that one looked forward 
to the battle with a certain joy in the face of men 
whose dread of death was in many cases increased by 
anxiety for wife and child. It was also my principle 
not to raise their courage by big words nor to threaten 
the coward. I spoke rather to this effect:—I know 
well enough that no one will leave me in the lurch. 
We are all afraid, but we must fight against it. To 
be overcome by one’s weakness is only human. At 
such a moment look at your leader and your fellows. 
While I spoke I felt that what I said went home, 
and the results justified me in this psychological 
preparation. 

Schrader and I had our meal at night on a door 
laid on a wheelbarrow in the farmyard, and drank 
a bottle of wine. We then rolled ourselves up in 
our goat-shed, till the guard woke us at z a.m. with 
the announcement that the motor lorries were in 
the market-place ready to load up. 

In the ghostly light we rattled over the war-torn 
country of last year’s Cambrai battle, through villages 
in grotesque states of destruction, with their streets 
bordered by billows of wreckage. Just before Beugny 
we were unloaded and led to our position. The 
battalion was occupying a hollow on the road Beugny- 
Vaux. During the morning an orderly brought orders 



MY LAST STORM 3°5 

for the company to push on to the road Fremicourt- 
Vaux. This typical forward movement made me sure 
that we were in for it till nightfall. 

I led my three platoons strung out in file, through 
a country over which aeroplanes circled, dropping 
bombs and scattering bullets. When we reached our 
objective we dispersed in shell-holes, as an occasional 
shell came over the road. 

I felt so bad that day that I lay down at once in 
a small length of trench and fell asleep. When I 
awoke I read Laurence Sterne’s Tristram Shandy, 
and thus the afternoon went by, while I lay in the 
sun with the apathy of an invalid. 

At 6.15 a despatch-rider summoned the company 
commanders to Captain von Weyhe. 

‘ I have to make the serious announcement that 
we are to attack. After half an hour's artillery pre¬ 
paration the battalion will advance at 7 (!) from 
the western edge of Favreuil and storm the enemy 
lines. You are to march on the church tower of 
Sapignies.’ 

After brief coming and going and a hearty hand¬ 
shake we rushed back to our companies, as the artillery 
fire began in ten minutes and we had still a good 
way to march. 

‘ By sections in single file at twenty metres interval. 
Direction, half left, tree-tops at Favreuil.’ 

A good sign of the spirit that was in the men now 
as ever was that I had to detail one man to stay behind 
to tell the cookers where to go. No one would 
volunteer. 

I walked far ahead of the company with my com- 

u 



MY LAST STORM 


306 

pany staff and Sergeant-major Reinecke. The shots 
of our guns were bursting out from behind hedges 
and ruins. Their fire sounded more like a furious 
yapping than a wave of destruction. Behind me I 
saw my sections advancing in perfect order. Close 
to them like dust flew the clouds of shots from aero¬ 
planes ; the shrapnel, bullets, empty shells, and driving 
bands drove with a hellish whirr between the files 
of the thin human line. On the right Beuqultre 
lay under heavy shell-fire, and jagged fragments of 
iron hurtled heavily overhead and drove with a sudden 
jab into the clayey ground. 

Our advance was still more unpleasant behind the 
Beuquatre - Bapaume road. A salvo of H.E. went 
up madly behind and before and among us. We 
scattered and threw ourselves into shell-holes. The 
smoke of shell after shell hung in clouds over the 
edge of Favreuil, and through it rose and fell again 
brown fountains of earth, one rapidly succeeding 
another. I went forward alone, as far as the first 
ruined houses, to find the way, and then gave the 
signal with my cane to follow. 

The village was fringed with badly-shelled huts, 
and there detachments of the 1st and 2nd Companies 
assembled by degrees. A machine-gun had claimed 
several victims during the last part of the way. 
Among others, Vice-sergeant-major Balg of my 
company was hit in the leg. A figure in a brown 
waterproof came quietly across this fire-swept piece 
of ground and shook hands with me. Kius and Boje, 
Captain Junker and Schaper, Schrader, Schlager, 
Heins, Findeisen, Hohlemann, and Hoppenrath stood 



MY LAST STORM 


3©7 

behind a hedge that was being raked with lead and 
iron, and held a great council of war. On many 
a day of wrath we had fought on one battlefield 
together, and this time, too, the sun, already low 
in the west, was to gild the blood of all, or nearly 
all. 

Part of the 1st Battalion moved into the park of 
the chateau. Of the 2nd Battalion only my company 
and the 5th had come through the curtain of fire 
practically without casualties. We worked our way 
forward under cover of shell-holes and ruins to a 
sunken road on the western edge of the village. On 
the way I clapped on to my head a helmet I picked up, 
a precaution I never took except in critical moments. 
I was astonished to find Favreuil utterly deserted. 
Apparently the line of defence had been abandoned by 
the troops occupying it. 

Captain von Weyhe, now lying alone and severely 
wounded in a shell-hole in the village, had given 
orders that the 5th and 8th Companies were to form 
the first attacking line, the 6th the second, and the 
7th the third. As there was nothing to be seen so 
far of the 6th and the 8th, I decided to go ahead 
without bothering too long over the distribution of 
the attack in depth. 

It was 'already seven. Looking from between 
fragments of houses and stumps of trees, I saw an 
attacking party advance across the open in two 
waves under moderate rifle-fire. It must be the 
5th. 

I drew up my men in the sunken road and gave 
the order to advance in two waves. * At a hundred 



MY LAST STORM 


308 

metres interval. I myself will be between the first 
and second waves.’ 

It was our last storm. How often in years gone by 
we had stepped out into the western sun in a mood 
the same as now ! Les Eparges, Guillemont, St. 
Pierre Vaast, Langemarck, Passchendaele, Mceuvres, 
Vraucourt, Mory! Again the carnival of carnage 
beckoned. 

We left the sunken road quite according to pro¬ 
gramme, only * I myself,’ as the formula of command 
finely puts it, suddenly found myself near Lieutenant 
Schrader far in front of the first wave. 

Isolated rifle-shots rang out in front of us. My 
cane in my right hand and revolver in the left, I 
stumped ahead and, without observing it, left the 
advancing lines of the 5th Company partly behind 
us and partly on our right. Meanwhile I found that 
my Iron Cross had dropped to the ground from my 
breast. Schrader, my batman, and I began a zealous 
search for it, in spite of snipers, who seemed to be 
drawing ahead of us. At last Schrader extracted 
it from a tuft of grass and I fastened it securely on 
again. 

The ground began to fall. Indistinct figures were 
seen in motion against a background of brown 
earth. A machine-gun spat out its bullets at 
us. A sense of aimlessness took hold of me. 
Nevertheless, we began to charge at the double. 
In mid-jump over a piece of trench a piercing 
shock through the chest took away my breath. I 
spun head over heels with a loud cry and fell 
stunned to the ground.

I woke with a sense of great misfortune. I was 
pinned between narrow walls of earth, and along 
a row of crouching figures the cry was taken up : 
‘ Stretcher-bearers! The company commander is 
wounded/ 

An elderly man of another company was leaning 
over me with a kindly expression, loosening my belt 
and opening my tunic. Two blood-red circular 
marks shone out on the middle of my right breast 
and on my back. I was crippled and chained to 
earth, and the close air of the narrow trench bathed 
me in sweat. My good Samaritan revived me by 
fanning me with my map-case. My hope as I struggled 
for breath was for darkness to come soon, so that I 
could be carried back. 

Of a sudden a hurricane of fire broke on us from 
Sapignies. It was clear that this unbroken roll, this 
even and regular roaring and stamping, betokened 
more than a defensive measure against so poorly 
staged an attack as ours. Above me I could see 
beneath his helmet Schrader’s strong face, as like 
a machine he loaded and fired, loaded and fired. 
A conversation arose between us that recalled the 
tower scene of the Maid of Orleans . Humor¬ 
ous as it was, it was all the same hardly in my 
mood, for I had the clear consciousness that I was 
done 

Above rose a cry of horror and ran from mouth 
to mouth : * They ’re through on the left! We ’re 
surrounded ! ’ 

This gave me back my old strength again. I 
fastened upon a hole that a mole had bored in the 



MY LAST STORM 


3 *o 

trench wall and pulled myself to my feet, while 
the blood poured from my mouth. With bare 
head and open coat I stared, revolver in hand, 
into the fight. 

Through whitish swathes of smoke a row of men 
with packs came on in a straight line. Some fell 
and lay there, others turned head over heels like shot 
hares. A hundred metres in front of us the last 
were sucked down into the shell-pocked earth. They 
must have been young troops, still unacquainted 
with the effects of the modern rifle, for they came on 
with all the hardihood of ignorance. 

As though drawn by strings, four tanks crept over 
the crest of a rise. In a few minutes our artillery had 
trodden them into the ground. One broke across like 
a tin engine. On my right the brave Mohrmann 
collapsed with a cry of death. 

It did not seem that all was lost. I whispered 
to Fahnrich Wilsky to creep to the left and enfilade 
the gap in our line. He came back almost at once 
and announced that twenty metres from us the show 
was up and all were surrendering. It was part of the 
99th Regiment there (Zabern). I turned round and 
saw a strange sight. From the rear there were men 
coming forward with their hands up. The enemy 
must already have taken the village from which we 
went to the attack. 

The scene became more and more lively. We 
were surrounded by a circle of Germans and English 
and called upon to throw down our weapons. I 
urged those nearest me in a weak voice to fight 
it out to the death. Friend and foe were fired on

alike. Some who surrounded our little band were 
shouting, some were dumb. On the left two gigantic 
Englishmen were using their bayonets in a length 
of trench from which hands were held up imploring 
mercy. 

Among us, too, there was heard a tumult of voices. 

‘ It’s all up ! Throw away your rifle! Don’t shoot, 
Kameraden! ’ 

I looked at the two officers who were with me in 
the trench. They smiled back and with a shrug let 
their belts fall to the ground. 

There was left only the choice of being taken or 
being shot. And now the moment had come to 
show whether all that I had often said to the men 
when on rest about the fighting spirit was more than 
empty phrases. I crawled out of the trench and 
staggered off in the direction of Favreuil. Two 
Englishmen who were taking a haul of prisoners of 
the 99th Regiment to their own lines barred my 
way. I shot the nearest one in the middle of the 
body with my revolver. He collapsed like a dummy 
figure. The other blazed his rifle at me and missed. 
These quick movements caused the blood to be 
driven clear of the lung in deep pulsations. I could 
breathe more freely, and set off at a run over the 
open beside the trench. Lieutenant Schliger was 
crouching behind a traverse with a section who were 
still firing. They joined forces with me. Some 
English who were going over the open stopped to 
get a Lewis gun in position and began shooting at us. 
Except for me, Schlager, and two others, not one 
escaped. Schlager, who had lost his pince-nez, told 



312 MY LAST STORM 

me afterwards that he saw nothing but my map-case 
flying up and down. The continuous loss of blood 
gave me the lightness and airiness of intoxication. 
One thing only bothered me—that I might collapse 
too soon. . . . 

At last we reached a half-moon-shaped earthwork 
to the right of Favreuil whence half a dozen heavy 
machine-guns were pumping lead on friend and foe 
without distinction. Enemy shots were spluttering 
against the parapet; men danced to and fro in the 
greatest excitement. A N.C.O. of the Medical Corps 
attached to the 6th Company tore off my tunic and 
advised me to lie down at once, as otherwise I might 
bleed to death in a very few minutes. 

I was rolled in a ground-sheet and carried past the 
outskirts of Favreuil. Some men of my own and the 
6th Company went with me. 

After a few hundred paces we were fired on from 
the village at close range. The shots went with a 
smack into the human bodies. The stretcher-bearer 
of the 6th Company who carried the rear end of my 
ground-sheet was laid out with a bullet through the 
head ; I was dropped as he fell. 

The small detachment had thrown themselves 
flat on the ground and now crept to the nearest 
hollow, with bullets dropping into the ground all 
round them. 

I lay by myself, firmly secured in my ground-sheet, 
awaiting the coup de grace . 

And yet, so long as a man of my company lived, 
I was not quite forsaken. Near by I heard Lance- 
corporal Hengstmann’s voice: ‘ I ’ll take you on 



MY LAST STORM 


3*3 

my back, sir. Either we ’ll get through or, at worst, 
we ’ll lie where we fall.’ 

Unfortunately, we did not get through. Too many 
rifles were aimed at us at almost point-blank range. 
He took me on his back with my arms round his 
neck, but before we had gone very far there was a 
metallic report and Hengstmann sank softly beneath 
me to the ground. I released myself from his arms 
that were still clasped under my knees, and found 
that a bullet had passed through helmet and temples. 
This brave man was a schoolmaster’s son from Letter 
near Hanover. 

This evil precedent did not deter another from 
coming to my aid and venturing on a fresh attempt 
to rescue me. It was Sergeant Strichalsky of the 
Medical Corps. He took me on his shoulders and 
carried me safely to the blind side of the rise of 
ground. 

It was getting dark. The men found the ground- 
sheet of a dead man and carried me over a deserted 
stretch of ground over which, far and near, jagged 
flashes were flaming up. I had to struggle for breath, 
one of the most painful sensations there are. The 
smoke of the cigarette that a man was smoking ten 
paces in front threatened to suffocate me. 

At length we reached a dressing-station in charge 
of a friend of mine, Dr. Key. He made me a divine 
lemon-squash, and then put me into a refreshing 
sleep with an injection of morphine. 

Next day began the usual journey by stages to the 
rear. The terrible journey by car to the war hospital 
brought me to the edge of the grave. Then I was in 



MY LAST STORM 


3i4 

nurses’ hands. Though I am no misogynist, I was 
always irritated by the presence of women every 
time that the fate of battle threw me into the bed of 
a hospital ward. One sank, after the manly and pur¬ 
poseful activities of the war, into a vague atmosphere 
of warmth. The clear objectivity of the Catholic 
nursing sisterhoods afforded a welcome exception. 
I found with them an atmosphere very congenial to 
soldiering. 

My wound was made lighter by many expres¬ 
sions of sympathy; and indeed bodily suffering 
always increases the sensibility of the inner being. 
From the Plancots I had a delightful letter, written 
when the enemy, who were gaining ground very 
slowly, first began shelling Cambrai. They sent 
me also a tin of milk they could ill spare, and the 
only melon their garden had produced. I must not 
let slip this opportunity of saying that I found many 
an example among the French civilian population 
of that internationality of the heart that every decent 
man and educated soldier ought to uphold. The 
last of my long series of batmen, too, was no excep¬ 
tion to the rest. He stuck by me, though the hospital 
allowed no provisions to be made for him and he had 
to beg what he could in the kitchen. 

I amused myself once during the monotonous 
hours on my back by counting the number of times 
I had been hit. I found that I had been hit in all 
fourteen times : six times by rifle-bullets, once by 
a shrapnel bullet, once by a shell splinter, three times 
by bomb splinters, and twice by splinters of rifle- 
bullets. Counting the ins and outs, this made pre- 



MY LAST STORM

cisely twenty punctures, so that I might confidently, 
with that Roman centurion, Holkschen Reiter, take 
my place in every warlike circle. Certainly I could 
at any time assert my claim to belong to one order 
at least, namely, that of the gold wound-stripes. 
This honour did in fact come to me at this very time, 
though the gold, certainly, was only yellow-lacquered 
metal. Yet I must confess I had it sewn on my coat 
with a certain pleasure, for if doctors and professors, 
for all their correctness,* do not look askance upon 
the stamp of an official title, why should the soldier 
refuse a visible sign of his gallantry ? The worth 
of an order, as of everything else, lies not on but 
beneath the surface; and who would grudge a heart 
that has so often beaten fast in the excitement of 
battle for country's sake the adornment of a bit 
of enamel as the outward sign ? In huckstering times, 
indeed, when everything turns on money, these things 
lose their value, for it rests solely within the ideal 
with which they are bound up. 

After fourteen days I was lying on the feather 
mattress of a hospital train. Once again a German 
landscape flitted by me, tinged this time with the 
first dyes of autumn, and once again, as on that time 
at Heidelberg, I was gripped by the sad and proud 
feeling of being more closely bound to my country 
because of the blood shed for her greatness. Why 
should I conceal that tears smarted in my eyes when 
I thought of the end of the enterprise in which I 
had borne my share ? I had set out to the war gaily 
enough, thinking we were to hold a festival on which 
all the pride of youth was lavished, and I had thought 



MY LAST STORM 


316 

little, once I was in the thick of it, about the ideal 
that I had to stand for. Now I looked back: four 
years of development in the midst of a generation 
predestined to death, spent in caves, smoke-filled 
trenches, and shell - illumined wastes; years en¬ 
livened only by the pleasures of a mercenary, and 
nights of guard after guard in an endless perspective; 
in short, a monotonous calendar full of hardships 
and privation, divided by the red-letter days of battles. 
And almost without any thought of mine, the idea of 
the Fatherland had been distilled from all these afflic¬ 
tions in a clearer and brighter essence. That was 
the final winnings in a game on which so often all 
had been staked : the nation was no longer for me an 
empty thought veiled in symbols; and how could 
it have been otherwise when I had seen so many die 
for its sake, and been schooled myself to stake my life 
for its credit every minute, day and night, without 
a thought ? And so, strange as it may sound, I learned 
from this very four years’ schooling in force and in 
all the fantastic extravagance of material warfare that 
life has no depth of meaning except when it is pledged 
for an ideal, and that there are ideals in comparison 
with which the life of an individual and even of a 
people has no weight. And though the aim for which 
I fought as an individual, as an atom in the whole 
body of the army, was not to be achieved, though 
material force cast us, apparently, to the earth, yet 
we learned once and for all to stand for a cause and 
if necessary to fall as befitted men. 

Hardened as scarcely another generation ever was 
in fire and flame, we could go into life as though 



MY LAST STORM

from the anvil; into friendship, love, politics, pro¬ 
fessions, into all that destiny had in store. It is not 
every generation that is so favoured. 

And if it be objected that we belong to a time of 
crude force our answer is : We stood with our feet 
in mud and blood, yet our faces were turned to things 
of exalted worth. And not one of that countless 
number who fell in our attacks fell for nothing. Each 
one fulfilled his own resolve. For to every one may 
be applied the saying from St. John that Dostoievski 
put in front of his greatest novel: 

* Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a com of 
wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone : 
but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.’ 

To-day we cannot understand the martyrs who 
threw themselves into the arena in a transport that 
lifted them even before their deaths beyond humanity, 
beyond every phase of pain and fear. Their faith 
no longer exercises a compelling force. When once 
it is no longer possible to understand how a man 
gives his life for his country—and the time will come 
—then all is over with that faith also, and the idea 
of the Fatherland is dead; and then, perhaps, we 
shall be envied, as we envy the saints their inward 
and irresistible strength. For all these great and 
solemn ideas bloom from a feeling that dwells in the 
blood and that cannot be forced. In the cold light 
of reason everything alike is a matter of expedience 
and sinks to the paltry and mean. It was our luck 
to live in the invisible rays of a feeling that filled 
the heart, and of this inestimable treasure we can 
never be deprived. 



MY LAST STORM

I had the good fortune to be taken out at Hanover 
and sent to the Clementine infirmary. One of my com¬ 
panions there was a young flying-man of Richthofen’s 
squadron, named Wenzel, who had shot down twelve 
of the enemy. The last of them had first shot him 
through the shoulder. 

On the 22nd of September 1918 I had the following 
telegram : 

‘ His Majesty the Kaiser has bestowed on you the 
order Pour le Merite. I congratulate you in the 
name of the whole Division. 

* General von Busse.’ 

As soon as I was fit enough I celebrated this event 
with Wenzel, my brother, and a few friends. As a 
doubt had been expressed whether we should soon 
be passed out fit for active service, Wenzel and I felt 
ourselves compelled to jump again and again over a 
large armchair. We came out of it, however, very 
badly. Wenzel broke his arm again, and I was kept 
in bed next morning with a temperature of 104. 

In spite of this it was not long before we were in 
excellent form for another winter campaign. This 
was deferred for a while ; and we soon had to take 
part in other battles than we ever dreamed. 

Now these too are over, and already we see once 
more in the dim light of the future the tumult of 
fresh ones. We—by this I mean those of the youth 
of this land who are capable of enthusiasm for an 
ideal—will not shrink from them. We stand in the 
memory of the dead who are holy to us, and we

believe ourselves entrusted with the true and spiritual 
welfare of our people. We stand for what will be 
and for what has been. Though force without and 
barbarity within conglomerate in sombre clouds, yet 
so long as the blade of a sword will strike a spark 
in the night may it be said: Germany lives and 
Germany shall never go under !
